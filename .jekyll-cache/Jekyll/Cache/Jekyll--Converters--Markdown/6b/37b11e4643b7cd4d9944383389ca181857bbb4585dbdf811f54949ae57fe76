<p>Most of us understand the value of planning and preparation. A sports match without a game plan means <em>fumbling</em> on the field. A big event without all the details in place leads to chaos.</p>

<p>Despite this knowledge, we often fail to <em>prioritize</em> planning where it <em>matters</em> most: our daily lives. Getting started in the <em>morning</em> without a clear plan sets us up to fail.</p>

<p>We set goals on the order of seasons and years, but itâ€™s what we do each day â€” the habits we adopt, the tasks we complete, and the things we <em>prioritize</em> â€” that compound over time into success or failure. A few aimless days each month can help us <em>reset</em> and find balance. But when our days without intention exceed our days with purpose, we end up missing our goals and wondering where all the time went.</p>

<p>The best defense against <em>hectic</em> yet <em>unproductive</em> days is a good offense in the form of a daily planning ritual. This article will walk you through how to plan your days for calmer, more <em>focused</em> productivity that brings you closer to your goals. While planning your day should only take 10-15 minutes, the <em>underlying</em> strategies to <em>meaningfully</em> craft a day with intention are worth exploring in full.</p>

<h2 id="make-regular-planning-a-habit">Make regular planning a habit</h2>

<p><em>James</em> Clear, the best-<em>selling</em> author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299"><em>Atomic</em> Habits</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/motivation">thinks motivation is <em>overrated</em></a>: â€œStop <em>waiting</em> for motivation or inspiration to strike you and set a schedule for your habitsâ€. Motivation flows from action, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why having a daily planning ritual is so important. Some mornings we feel <em>motivated</em> to seize the day and create a to-do list that reflects our big ambitions. But those days are the exception. We need to get things <em>done</em> even when we wake up tired and <em>disengaged</em>, wanting to return to bed or <em>longing</em> for Friday at 5 PM. Those are the days itâ€™s most important to approach the day with a plan.</p>

<p>Start by setting an alarm for your daily planning session at the same time every day â€” either during a <a href="https://blog.doist.com/end-work-day/">work <em>shutdown</em> ritual</a> or first thing in the <em>morning</em>. To make building the habit easier, <a href="https://blog.doist.com/temptation-bundling/"><em>bundle</em></a> your new daily planning session with an existing habit like drinking your <em>morning</em> coffee or <em>listening</em> to music.</p>

<p>Use a to-do list app like <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to set a <em>recurring</em> task to plan your day, or simply set an alarm on your phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-02.png" alt="how to plan your day quick add task" />Use a to-do list app like <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to set a <em>recurring</em> task to plan your day.</p>

<p>Habits are easier to build when we see the results of our <em>dedication</em> right away. <em>Luckily</em>, planning your day is a habit that pays off immediately. Youâ€™ll feel more <em>organized</em>, <em>focused</em>, and <em>motivated</em> with a plan for the hours ahead. Over time, planning your day will become second-nature.</p>

<p>Keep your daily planning habit <em>going</em> on the weekends, even if youâ€™re aiming for a <em>laid</em> back day. Add <em>errands</em>, a movie, or dinner dates to your daily to-do list on a Saturday or Sunday to make real space on your schedule for <em>relaxation</em>, <em>leisure</em>, and side projects.</p>

<h2 id="build-your-to-do-list-around-your-goals">Build your to-do list around your goals</h2>

<p><em>Making</em> a habit of your daily planning is one thing. Ensuring that your plan is actually <em>inching</em> you towards your bigger goals is another. Use your daily planning session to make sure your daily tasks are <em>aligned</em> with your long-term objectives. Here are a few steps to get you there:</p>

<h3 id="step-one-break-down-your-big-goals">Step one: Break down your big goals</h3>

<p>Break down your goals into daily tasks. For example, you canâ€™t add â€œGet in shapeâ€ to your daily to-do list, but you can add tasks like â€œspend 30 minutes on my Pelotonâ€ or â€œgo for a <em>nightly</em> <em>stroll</em>â€. Review your <em>personal</em> and professional goals when you sit down to plan your day, and add tasks that get you closer to both.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-03.png" alt="long term goals and potential tasks" />Break down long-term goals into daily tasks.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re <em>struggling</em> to create <em>realistic</em> daily to-do lists that reflect all of your goals, you may have too many. <em>Overextending</em> yourself isnâ€™t only <em>tiring</em>, it also means youâ€™re unlikely to make meaningful progress in all these areas. Complete a <a href="https://blog.doist.com/get-everything-done-still-have-time-to-play/">commitment <em>inventory</em></a> to hone in on a smaller number of goals that are most important to you. As a general rule, avoid having more than 5 big goals at once, and consider a mix of short-term and long-term goals.</p>

<h3 id="step-two-look-at-your-week-as-a-whole">Step two: Look at your week as a whole</h3>

<p>Planning your day starts with considering your week as a whole. You likely have multiple goals, an array of <em>potential</em> tasks to accomplish them, and only so many hours in the day. Thatâ€™s okay. While some goals benefit from daily action, working towards others a few times a week can create momentum. Maybe you exercise Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On some days, you may want to <a href="https://blog.doist.com/time-blocking">task <em>batch</em></a> and focus only on to-dos related to one specific professional goal. <em>Alternatively</em>, you might stack your <em>personal</em> goal tasks on the weekend. Take the time on Sunday evening or Monday <em>morning</em> to <em>zoom</em> out and lightly <em>sketch</em> your week so you know which goals youâ€™ll focus on and on which days. Save the details for your daily planning sessions.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-04.png" alt="task batch week based on goals" />Plan your day by considering your week as a whole and <a href="https://blog.doist.com/time-blocking">task <em>batching</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-three-add-your-have-to-do-tasks-last">Step three: Add your have-to-do tasks last</h3>

<p>This is the step that most people start with when they plan their day. They begin with their set appointments, <em>mandatory</em> meetings, <em>urgent</em> deadlines, and then try to fit goal-<em>oriented</em> tasks around them. Instead, consider <em>keeping</em> this step for the end. This way, youâ€™re <em>forced</em> to fit your have-to-do tasks around your goal tasks rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we would focus only on daily tasks that move us <em>toward</em> our long-term goals. In reality, we have commitments and obligations that we have to <em>fulfill</em> â€“â€“ some of which have little impact on our <em>personal</em> or professional growth. <em>Cull</em> these commitments and obligations as much as possible: reevaluate <em>recurring</em> meetings, consider delegating responsibilities, and get comfortable with <em>saying</em> â€œnoâ€. However, itâ€™s okay to have things on your to-do list that simply need to get <em>done</em>. Just make sure they arenâ€™t <em>taking</em> over too much of your time and energy.</p>

<p>Learn more about <em>aligning</em> your day with your long-term priorities and commitments in our article on the productivity method, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>. This method forces you to <em>continuously</em> <em>trim</em> your list, create a commitment <em>inventory</em>, and assign time to your tasks that <em>matter</em> most.</p>

<h2 id="have-one-daily-priority">Have one daily priority</h2>

<p>Many of us start our mornings with <em>dozens</em> of things we need to get <em>done</em> only to realize at the end of the day we <em>haven</em>â€™t <em>crossed</em> any of them off our lists. Sure, we got stuff <em>done</em>, but none of the things we <em>planned</em>. The counter-<em>intuitive</em> solution for getting more <em>done</em>? Pick just one big task per day.</p>

<p>You may be thinking: â€œHow can I achieve all my goals if I only focus on one task per day?â€. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422/ref=as_li_ss_tl?linkCode=sl1&amp;slotNum=1&amp;s=gateway&amp;linkId=9239c35565c3ef2bdf0328cd048237fa&amp;keywords=make+time&amp;imprToken=rQ.6XkW9weviSyuimO6KuQ&amp;language=en_US&amp;tag=maketimeblog-20&amp;qid=1552223860&amp;sr=8-1">Make Time: How to Focus on What <em>Matters</em> Every Day</a>, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky <em>discuss</em> the <em>sneaky</em> phenomenon of <em>busyness</em> without productivity. In between meetings and ad-hoc requests, it can feel like weâ€™re on a treadmill we canâ€™t get off.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-05.png" alt="hectic days" />Many of us start our mornings with <em>dozens</em> of things we need to get <em>done</em>, only to realize at the end of the day we <em>haven</em>â€™t <em>crossed</em> any of them off.</p>

<p>As a <em>balm</em> against <em>hectic</em> days that pass without progress, they introduce the concept of the â€œHighlightâ€:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe first stepâ€¦is <em>deciding</em> what you want to make time for. Every day, youâ€™ll choose a single activity to <em>prioritize</em> and protect in your <em>calendar</em>.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If youâ€™re <em>struggling</em> to select what your Highlight or top priority for the day might be, Knapp and Zeratsky suggest this simple <em>heuristic</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBegin each day by thinking about what you hope will be the bright spot. If, at the end of the day, someone asks you, â€˜What was the highlight of your day?â€™ what do you want your answer to be? When you look back on your day, what activity or accomplishment or moment do you want to <em>savor</em>? Thatâ€™s your Highlight.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If weâ€™re being honest, <em>ending</em> the day with at least one big task out of the way is a <em>marked</em> improvement over what many of us are doing now. On a longer time-scale, <em>finishing</em> 5-7 big things per week is significant. Does that mean youâ€™ll only complete one task per day? Generally, no. However, selecting and completing a single significant to-do fills us with a sense of accomplishment that creates momentum to <em>tackle</em> other tasks too.</p>

<p>Use a task manager like <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to mark the Highlight for your day as high priority and move it to the top of your list.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-06.png" alt="Todoist for how to plan your day" />Use a task manager like <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to help you focus on a daily priority.</p>

<p><em>Alternatively</em>, if youâ€™re <em>opting</em> for <a href="https://blog.doist.com/pen-and-paper-productivity/">pen and paper productivity</a>, simply star, highlight or <em>underline</em> the most important task on your to-do list in your notebook or daily planner.</p>

<p>Regardless of the tools you use, make extreme <em>prioritization</em> a key part of how you plan your day.</p>

<h2 id="plan-your-day-with-a-productivity-method">Plan your day with a productivity method</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.doist.com/personal-productivity-methods/">productivity method</a> is both an effective way to get things <em>done</em> and a strategy for planning your day.</p>

<p>Below, we share a few popular productivity methods you can choose from to <em>tackle</em> your tasks and how to use them for daily planning. Find a productivity method that works for you â€“â€“ even if that means <em>remixing</em> an existing one or creating a new one from <em>scratch</em>. Here are some popular methods for daily planning to get started with:</p>

<h3 id="eat-the-frog">Eat the <em>Frog</em></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.doist.com/eat-the-frog-todoist/">Eat the <em>Frog</em></a> productivity method asks you to identify one important task for the day and do it first. This is a great method for <em>putting</em> your highlight into action early. <em>Sometimes</em> itâ€™s the task we most want to avoid (<em>hence</em>, eating the <em>frog</em>). This could be the task that feels too big to <em>tackle</em> or the one that makes us uncomfortable. Attack it straight away before you have a chance to <em>procrastinate</em>.</p>

<p>During your daily planning session, put your â€œ<em>frog</em>â€ task at the top of your to-do list and assign a time. Then, place your other tasks below.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-08.png" alt="How to plan your day Eat the Frog to-do list" />A to-do list <em>organized</em> around the Eat the <em>Frog</em> productivity method</p>

<h3 id="pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.doist.com/pomodoro-technique-todoist/">Pomodoro Technique</a> is best for people who enjoy working in short <em>focused</em> <em>sprints</em> with frequent breaks. This method was <em>developed</em> in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, then a <em>struggling</em> <em>student</em>, who <em>committed</em> to just 10 minutes of <em>focused</em> <em>study</em> using a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) <em>shaped</em> kitchen <em>timer</em>. This method includes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get a <em>timer</em>.</li>
  <li>Set your <em>timer</em> for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the <em>timer</em> rings.</li>
  <li>When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you <em>completed</em>.</li>
  <li>Enjoy a five-minute break.</li>
  <li>After four <em>intervals</em>, or â€œpomodori,â€ take a longer, 20- to 30-minute break.</li>
</ol>

<p>To plan your day with the Pomodoro technique, estimate how many pomodoros (25-minute work sessions) youâ€™ll need to complete each task on your list. Note that number in front of each task with a tomato emoji or simply the number itself in <em>brackets</em>. This method forces you to consider how long your work will take and plan <em>accordingly</em>. You can <em>opt</em> to use pomodoros for your entire day or simply use the method for your top task.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-09.png" alt="How to plan your day Pomodoro to-do list" />A to-do list <em>organized</em> around the Pomodoro productivity method</p>

<h3 id="time-blocking">Time Blocking</h3>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.doist.com/time-blocking/">Time Blocking</a> productivity method, split up your day into distinct blocks of time. This could be as specific as 9:30AM-11:30AM or simply â€œ<em>Morning</em>â€ depending on how long a task might take. Then, work without <em>distraction</em> and dedicate each block of time to completing only a specific task or set of tasks.</p>

<p>Like the Pomodoro technique, this method will help you estimate and understand how long your to-dos take. Make sure to include blocks for things like lunch, breaks, and commutes for the most accuracy. Often a task will take more or less time than you anticipate. Thatâ€™s okay. Make quick modifications to your list as you move through the day. With time, youâ€™ll get a better understanding of how long tasks take. In the <em>meantime</em>, a good rule of thumb is to double the amount of time you think something will take.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-10.png" alt="How to plan your day time Blocking to-do list" />A to-do list <em>organized</em> around the time blocking productivity method</p>

<h3 id="eisenhower-matrix">Eisenhower <em>Matrix</em></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.doist.com/eisenhower-matrix/">Eisenhower <em>Matrix</em></a> productivity method forces you to consider the <em>urgency</em> and importance of each task, instead of only doing whatâ€™s most <em>urgent</em> â€” <em>whether</em> itâ€™s crucial or not. This method breaks down tasks into four quadrants and <em>prescribes</em> how we should deal with tasks that fall into each one:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œ<em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€ tasks should be <em>completed</em> immediately</li>
  <li>â€œNot <em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€ tasks should be <em>scheduled</em> on your to-do list or <em>calendar</em></li>
  <li>â€œ<em>Urgent</em> and <em>Unimportant</em>â€ tasks should be <em>delegated</em> to someone else</li>
  <li>â€œNot <em>Urgent</em> and <em>Unimportant</em> tasksâ€ should be <em>deleted</em></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-11.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix" />The Eisenhower <em>Matrix</em> breaks down tasks into four quadrants and <em>prescribes</em> to help us <em>prioritize</em>.</p>

<p>To start, craft your regular to-do list, including all your tasks for the day. Next, sort them into the four categories of â€œ<em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€, â€œNon-<em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€, â€œ<em>Urgent</em> and <em>Unimportant</em>â€, and â€œNot <em>Urgent</em> and <em>Unimportant</em>â€. Once you have these categories, act on your to-do list <em>accordingly</em>: do, schedule, <em>delegate</em>, and <em>delete</em> tasks from your to-do list as you plan out your day.</p>

<p>In time, this process will become second nature and youâ€™ll naturally draft a single to-do list with only â€œ<em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€ and â€œNon-<em>Urgent</em> and Importantâ€ tasks on your list.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-12.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix to-do list" />A to-do list <em>organized</em> around the Eisenhower <em>Matrix</em> productivity method.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-planning-tool">Choose your planning tool</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ve decided on an approach to your daily planningâ€”now itâ€™s time to pick your tools. From productivity software to paper and pen, here are some of the most popular options:</p>

<h3 id="a-to-do-list-app">A to-do list app</h3>

<p>A <em>digital</em> task manager is a great choice for those who are tech-<em>savvy</em> and <em>conditioned</em> to reach for their phone or <em>tablet</em> instead of a notebook. To-do lists apps have the benefit of <em>keeping</em> everything in one place and accessible from anywhere. You can seamlessly move tasks from day to day as your plans change, organize relevant documents and links alongside your tasks, and have an automatic, <em>searchable</em> record of everything youâ€™ve <em>done</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-13.png" alt="Planning tool Todoist" />A to-do list app like <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> has the benefit of <em>keeping</em> everything in one place and accessible from anywhere.</p>

The app includes many features like reminders, labels, filters, comments, and file <em>uploads</em> that make planning your day easier.</p>

<h3 id="a-digital-list">A <em>digital</em> list</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re not <em>keen</em> on a full-<em>fledged</em> task manager but still want a <em>digital</em> solution, consider less-<em>specialized</em> tools that you probably already use in your day-to-day at work and home.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A notes app or word processing app</strong>. Use a simple notes app like <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> (iOS and MacOS only), <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/notes/welcome/mac">Apple Notes</a>, or <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a> to keep a running list of your tasks for the day. Simply check off items using checkboxes or strikethrough <em>formatting</em>. For a more <em>robust</em> â€œnotesâ€ app, consider Google Docs or Microsoft Word for more flexibility and customization options.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-14.png" alt="Choose planning tool digital to-do list" />If youâ€™re not <em>keen</em> on a full-<em>fledged</em> task manager but still want a <em>digital</em> solution, consider less-<em>specialized</em> tools.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Sheets or Excel</strong>. Plan your day in a <em>spreadsheet</em>. This can help you add more context and notes to specific cells. Methods like time-blocking are also <em>conducive</em> to working in a <em>digital</em> <em>grid</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-digital-calendar">A <em>digital</em> <em>calendar</em></h3>

<p>Many people <em>opt</em> for a daily planning tool theyâ€™re already using â€“â€“ the <em>calendar</em>. Apple <em>Calendar</em>, Google <em>Calendar</em>, <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical"><em>Fantastical</em></a>, and <a href="https://woven.com/"><em>Woven</em></a> are all popular <em>calendar</em> apps that you can use to plan your day and add your tasks alongside appointments, meetings, and events. This is also a great tool to use with a productivity method like time blocking. <em>Additionally</em>, <em>digital</em> <em>calendars</em> have the benefit of being available on the go, generally on both web and <em>mobile</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://25r4fj22vjh18a4i91qamh06-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog_how-to-plan-your-day_graphic-15.png" alt="Planning tool digital calendar" />A <em>digital</em> <em>calendar</em> is a great tool to use with a productivity method like time blocking.</p>

<p>ğŸ’¡ <strong>Product Tip</strong></p>

<p>Use Google <em>Calendar</em> with Todoist and experience 2-way <em>sync</em> between your <em>scheduled</em> Todoist tasks and your Google <em>Calendar</em>. Any changes you make in Google <em>Calendar</em>, like <em>editing</em> an event name or changing the date, will instantly be <em>reflected</em> back in Todoist, and vice versa.</p>

<p>You can also use <em>Fantastical</em> with Todoist. With this integration, youâ€™ll be able to see all your tasks from Todoist directly in <em>Fantastical</em>, and any changes you make to Todoist tasks in <em>Fantastical</em> will <em>sync</em> back to Todoist and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="a-paper-planner">A paper planner</h3>

<p>For the <em>tactile</em> among us, paper and pen is the go-to for planning your day. This can take any number of forms including notebooks, agendas, or <em>specialized</em> planners. Weâ€™d only <em>caution</em> against post-it notes or loose paper. While simple and <em>scrappy</em>, ad-hoc scraps of paper prevent you from <em>looking</em> back at old tasks and reflecting on the effectiveness of your daily planning. [See the â€œReflect Regularlyâ€ section]</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Notebook</strong> â€” A simple <em>lined</em> or <em>unlined</em> notebook will do the trick for a simple pen and paper planning system. Use a new page for each day and mark the date at the top. Try <em>gridded</em> notebooks that can help with creating divisions if <em>needed</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily Agendas or Planner</strong>s â€” Agendas or <em>planers</em> are notebooks with space to plan each day of the year from January 1 to December 31. This provides <em>dedicated</em> space for daily planning and the ability to go back to previous and <em>upcoming</em> entries with greater ease.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Specialized* Planners</strong> â€” Weâ€™re *seeing</em> the rise of <em>specialized</em> <em>planers</em> or paper and pen planning systems like the <a href="https://passionplanner.com/">Passion Planner</a> or <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. These systems are often complex, but can be powerful systems for <em>dedicated</em> practitioners.</li>

<h3 id="a-digital-and-paper-hybrid">A <em>digital</em> and paper <em>hybrid</em></h3>

<p>When it comes to daily planning, you donâ€™t need to choose pen and paper or <em>digital</em> tools â€“â€“ you can use both or any combination of the methods mentioned. Here are a few different ways you can put a <em>hybrid</em> system to good use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em><strong>Personal* and professional split</strong>. Use a *digital</em> system for your professional tasks and a planner for your <em>personal</em> tasks. This can be a helpful method if you dedicate working hours to <em>striving</em> for professional goals and dedicate your evenings to <em>personal</em> tasks and self-growth. In the same <em>vein</em>, you might use a task manager during the week and a journal on the weekends.</li>
  <li><strong>Paper first, *digital* second</strong>. You might enjoy the <em>tactical</em> aspect of planning your day on paper but appreciate the searchability and <em>permanence</em> of <em>digital</em> tools. Plan your day using a schedule or daily planner but make time at the end of each day to transfer your to-dos and progress to a <em>digital</em> task manager for easy reference. This is also a great method if you <em>opt</em> for paper notes to avoid <em>distraction</em>. For instance, you might bring a notebook into a meeting and leave with action items and requests youâ€™ve <em>scrawled</em> in your notebook. You can then transfer these items to your <em>digital</em> to-do list, adding due dates and priority levels so they donâ€™t fall through the cracks.</li>
  <li><strong>Pen-and-paper thinking, *digital* execution</strong>. Some find that theyâ€™re more creative and think better when they have a blank page and a pen in hand. Get out your plans for the day on paper with any added notes and thoughts you might have. Then, move them to your <em>digital</em> to-do list to make your tasks more <em>actionable</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-stick-with-your-daily-plan--course-correct-when-needed">How to stick with your daily plan &amp; course-correct when <em>needed</em></h2>

<p>Even with a solid plan and the best of intentions, itâ€™s difficult to complete all our to-dos for the day. We <em>inevitably</em> find ourselves off-task, <em>lured</em> by <em>distractions</em> like <em>Twitter</em> memes and online shopping. Ad-hoc tasks, <em>assigned</em> by our managers or <em>delegated</em> from teammates, can arise that break our focus and force us to concentrate on <em>unplanned</em> items.</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately</em>, these <em>interruptions</em> can <em>snowball</em> into <em>unproductive</em> days and <em>ineffective</em> weeks. We decide that daily planning doesnâ€™t work, and thereâ€™s no point in <em>approaching</em> our days with intention. That couldnâ€™t be further from the truth!</p>

<p>Yes, our days will never go exactly as <em>planned</em>, but that doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t worth planning. Here are a few strategies, some straight from productivity experts, for <em>sticking</em> with your daily plan and course <em>correcting</em> when things go <em>awry</em>.</p>

<h3 id="eliminate-distractions">Eliminate <em>distractions</em></h3>

<p>Stay <em>focused</em> by eliminating common <em>distractions</em> that pull you away from your objectives for the day â€“â€“ <em>especially</em> if the <em>bulk</em> of your work is <em>done</em> with a <em>computer</em>. If possible, work with most of your <em>desktop</em> programs closed, with minimal <em>tabs</em> open, your phone on silent, and your <em>notifications</em> off.</p>

<p>If the call of social media <em>scrolling</em> is too strong, use a site <em>blocker</em> like <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">Self Control</a> or <a href="https://freedom.to/"><em>Freedom</em></a> to make <em>distracting</em> <em>websites</em> <em>inaccessible</em> for hours at a time.</p>

<h3 id="track-your-time">Track your time</h3>

<p>Just like <em>tracking</em> your <em>budget</em> can naturally help you spend less, <em>tracking</em> your time can help you use it more effectively. Use an automatic <em>tracking</em> app like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">Rescue Time</a> that collects information about <em>usage</em> on your <em>desktop</em> and <em>mobile</em> devices and sorts your time online into â€œproductiveâ€, â€œneutralâ€, and â€œ<em>distracting</em>â€. You can set daily productivity goals and check-in throughout the day to see <em>whether</em> or not youâ€™re nearing your goal or <em>falling</em> short of the target.</p>

<h3 id="try-hourly-check-ins">Try <em>hourly</em> check-ins</h3>

<p>Apply mindfulness to productivity by regularly <em>checking</em> in with yourself to notice if youâ€™re <em>moving</em> through your day with focus.</p>

<p><a href="https://bregmanpartners.com/">Peter Bergman</a>, an executive coach and the best-<em>selling</em> author of 18 Minutes, <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/07/an-18minute-plan-for-managing">suggests</a> setting a regular <em>timer</em> to refocus ourselves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œSet your watch, phone, or <em>computer</em> to ring every hour. When it rings, take a deep breath, look at your list and ask yourself if you <em>spent</em> your last hour productively. Then look at your <em>calendar</em> and <em>deliberately</em> <em>recommit</em> to how you are <em>going</em> to use the next hour. Manage your day hour by hour. Donâ€™t let the hours manage you.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="readjust-your-plan"><em>Readjust</em> your plan</h3>

<p><em>Sometimes</em> unexpected tasks arise that we canâ€™t ignore. Thatâ€™s fine. The problem arises when we try to take on this <em>unanticipated</em> work without <em>going</em> back to <em>revise</em> our initial plans. Instead, make <em>unplanned</em> to-dos part of a new plan. When you have to shift to an off-book task, take a few minutes to <em>readjust</em> your plan for the day: <em>reschedule</em> to-dos to later in the day or move them to tomorrow. Then, work off of your new plan.</p>

<p>Cal Newport, a <em>computer</em> science professor at Georgetown University and the best-<em>selling</em> author of <a href="https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/">Deep Work</a>, <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/">shares</a> his approach to <em>readjusting</em> his daily plan using the time blocking method with pen and paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œI leave some extra room next to my time blocks. This allows me to make <em>corrections</em> as <em>needed</em> if the day unfolds in an unexpected way.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="get-to-to-do-list-zero">Get to â€œTo Do List <em>Zero</em>â€</h3>

<p>Most days you wonâ€™t finish everything on your list. However, get to â€œTo-do List <em>Zero</em>â€ anyways. Amir SalihefendiÄ‡, the Founder and CEO of Doist, shares his <em>personal</em> productivity method, <a href="https://blog.doist.com/systemist-personal-workflow/?fbclid=IwAR0Xn2Scdy39B_s3PVZH-1blLiUsjrkKQOSzCOPxp78lrJiTMhktE8Niz8E">Systemist</a>, including â€œTo-do List <em>Zero</em>â€, a concept <em>inspired</em> by Inbox <em>Zero</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAt the end of the day I want to have <em>zero</em> tasks on my today list. The truth is that most days I donâ€™t complete everything on my today list and I <em>postpone</em> things. This isnâ€™t a negative thing. I see it as an opportunity to take stock of where Iâ€™m at, re-evaluate my tasks, and re-plan them.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By <em>ending</em> the evening with a clean <em>slate</em>, we can avoid getting <em>buried</em> in <em>overdue</em> tasks and <em>tackle</em> tomorrow with <em>renewed</em> energy.</p>

<h2 id="reflect-regularly">Reflect regularly</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ve made planning your day a habit, <em>translated</em> your long-term goals into <em>actionable</em> tasks, <em>chosen</em> a productivity method, and <em>selected</em> your tool of choice. Youâ€™re set for more productive days that build to more meaningful weeks, months, and years.</p>

<p>However, donâ€™t let your process run on <em>autopilot</em>. Take some time to regularly consider <em>whether</em> your approach to daily planning is <em>helping</em> you accomplish more. Make time every so often, perhaps during a <a href="https://blog.doist.com/weekly-review/">weekly review</a>, to consider <em>whether</em> your planning process is working or could be <em>tweaked</em> or even <em>overhauled</em> to be more effective.</p>

<p>Consider these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are my days calm and intentional or <em>stressful</em> and <em>haphazard</em>?</li>
  <li>Did I complete all my daily planning sessions or skip some?</li>
  <li>Do I feel <em>accomplished</em> at the end of most days?</li>
  <li>Are my high priority days being <em>addressed</em>?</li>
  <li>Am I on track to meet my long-term goals?</li>
  <li>This day was <em>especially</em> productive â€” why?</li>
  <li>I <em>accomplished</em> nothing <em>impactful</em> on this day â€” why?</li>
</ul>

<p>In being honest about how our days went and how weâ€™re faring on our big goals, we can fine-tune our daily planning for better results. <em>Hectic</em> days might mean we need to <em>prioritize</em> more effectively or find a way to <em>delegate</em> work. Missing daily planning sessions might mean theyâ€™re too long and could benefit from a more <em>streamlined</em> approach. If weâ€™re not <em>moving</em> towards our goals, it may mean we have too many or weâ€™re not adding them to our days with enough frequency or intention. We might simply like pen and paper while weâ€™ve <em>forced</em> ourselves to try a <em>shiny</em> new app. Whatever the issue, work to resolve it by modifying your daily planning process.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not <em>uncommon</em> to need to experiment and try a few <em>iterations</em> of daily planning before we land on the method that actually lead to getting more <em>done</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>When planning your day, aim for <em>consistency</em> and flexibility over <em>perfection</em>. While weâ€™ve provided tips and tactics for planning your day effectively, thereâ€™s no silver bullet solution. Instead, we feel the most ready to attack our day when we show up consistently. Productive days have a way of <em>turning</em> into productive weeks, months, and years. When we chip away at our tasks with intention and focus day by day, thereâ€™s no limit to what you can accomplish.</p>
