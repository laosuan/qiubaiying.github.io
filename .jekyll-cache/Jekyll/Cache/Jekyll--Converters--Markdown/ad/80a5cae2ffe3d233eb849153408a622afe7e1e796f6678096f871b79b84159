<p>伯克希尔哈撒韦公司致股东：</p>

<p>　　根据美国公认会计准则（GAAP），伯克希尔2020年的盈利为425亿美元。这一数字的四个组成部分是219亿美元的营业利润，49亿美元的实现资本利得，我们持有的股票中存在的净未实现资本利得增加所带来的267亿美元收益，最后，我们拥有的一些子公司和附属公司的价值减记导致的110亿美元损失。所有项目均在税后基础上列示。</p>

<p>　　营业利润是最重要的，即使它们不是我们公认会计准则总额中最大的项目。我们在伯克希尔的重点是增加我们的这部分收入和收购大的处于有利位置的企业。但去年，我们两个目标都没有实现：伯克希尔没有进行大规模收购，营业利润下降了9%。不过，通过保留收益和回购约5%的股票，我们确实提高了伯克希尔的每股内在价值。</p>

<p>　　与资本利得或损失（无论是已实现或未实现）相关的两个公认会计准则组成部分每年都在反复波动，这反映了股票市场的波动。无论今天的数据如何，我和我的长期合作伙伴查理·芒格都坚信，随着时间的推移，伯克希尔的投资收益将是可观的。</p>

<p>　　正如我多次强调的那样，查理和我将伯克希尔持有的上市股票（截至去年年底价值2810亿美元）视为一个企业集合。我们并不控制这些公司的运营，但我们确实按比例分享了它们的长期繁荣。然而，从会计角度来看，我们的那部分利润并没有包括在伯克希尔的收益中。相反，只有这些被投资方支付给我们的股息才会被记录在我们的账簿上。根据公认会计准则，被投资方代表我们保留的巨额资金也变成无形资产。</p>

<p>　　然而，这些看不见的东西不应该被忽视：这些未记录的留存收益通常为伯克希尔创造价值 —— 大量价值。被投资方利用这些留存资金来扩大业务、进行收购、偿还债务，通常还会回购股票（这种行为增加了我们在他们未来收益中所占的份额）。</p>

<p>　　正如我们在去年的股东信中指出的那样，留存收益在整个美国历史上推动了美国企业的发展。对卡内基和洛克菲勒行之有效的方法多年来对数百万股东也行之有效。</p>

<p>　　当然，我们的一些投资人会令人失望，他们留存的收益几乎没有增加他们公司的价值。但其他公司会超额完成任务，其中少数公司表现出色。总而言之，我们预计自己在伯克希尔非控股业务（别人会认为是我们的股票投资组合）留存的巨额收益中所占的份额，最终会给我们带来等量或更多的资本利得。在我们56年的任期中，这一期望一直得到满足。</p>

<p>　　我们GAAP数据的最后一个组成部分——丑陋的110亿美元减记——几乎是全部量化我在2016年犯的一个错误。那一年，伯克希尔收购了精密铸件公司（Precision Castparts，“PCC”），我付了太多的钱。</p>

<p>　　没有人以任何方式误导我——我只是对PCC的正常盈利潜力过于乐观。去年，作为PCC最重要的客户来源，整个航空航天业的不利发展，暴露了我的误判。</p>

<p>　　在收购PCC的过程中，伯克希尔收购了一家很好的公司，同行业中最好的一家。PCC的首席执行官马克-多尼根是一位充满激情的经理，他一如既往地将同样的精力投入到我们收购的业务中。我们很幸运有他来管理。</p>

<p>　　我认为我的结论是正确的，PCC将随着时间的推移，在其运营中部署的净有形资产上获得良好的回报。然而，我对未来收益的判断是错误的，因此，我也就错误地计算出了为收购该企业支付的合理价格。</p>

<p>　　PCC远非我犯下的第一个错误。但这是一个大错误。</p>

<p>　　<strong>我们的弓上有两根弦</strong></p>

<p>　　伯克希尔哈撒韦经常被贴上“综合企业集团”的标签，这是一个贬义词，指的是拥有大量不相关业务的控股公司。是的，这是对伯克希尔正确的描述——但只是部分描画。为了更好理解我们如何以及为什么不同于其他综合性企业集团，让我们回顾一下历史。</p>

<p>　　长期以来，综合企业集团通常会局限于收购整个企业。然而，这一战略带来了两个大问题。有一个问题是无解的：大多数真正伟大的企业都无意让别人接管。因此，渴望收购的企业集团不得不专注于那些缺乏重要和持久竞争优势的一般公司。那不是一个钓鱼的好池塘。</p>

<p>　　除此之外，当联合企业不得不收购平庸的公司时，他们常常发现自己需要支付惊人的“控制权”溢价，以诱捕他们的猎物。一些精明的企业集团知道如何解决这个“超额支付”的问题：他们只需让自己公司估值变得高得离谱，来作为昂贵收购的“货币”。（“我愿意花1万美元买你的狗，做法是把我单价5000美元的两只猫给你。”）</p>

<p>　　通常，让综合企业集团股票估值过高的手段包括促销和“富有想象力的”会计操作，这些手段充其量是欺骗性的，有时甚至会越界成为欺诈。当这些招数“成功”时，这家集团会将自己的股价推至商业价值的三倍，以便收购估值是实际价值两倍的目标公司。</p>

<p>　　投资幻想可以持续相当长的时间。华尔街喜欢并购交易产生的费用，而媒体则喜欢精彩的推介者提供的故事。同样，有时候，一只被推销的股票飙升的价格本身也可以成为投资幻想就是现实的“证据”。</p>

<p>　　最终，当然，盛宴结束，许多商业“皇帝”没穿衣服。金融历史上充斥着许多著名企业集团的名字，这些企业家最初被记者、分析师和投资银行家誉为商业天才，但后来却被抛进商业垃圾场。</p>

<p>　　大集团声名狼藉。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>**</p>

<p>　　芒格和我希望我们的企业集团拥有具有良好财务状况和优秀经理人的多元化企业集团的全部或部分，而伯克希尔是否控制这些业务对我们来说并不重要。</p>

<p>　　我花了好一会儿才明白过来。但是芒格，还有我在伯克希尔继承的纺织业务中苦苦挣扎的20年经验，最终说服了我，拥有一个很棒的企业的不控股股权，要比拥有控股100%的挣扎在边缘企业更有利可图，更愉快，更少工作量。</p>

<p>　　基于这些原因，我们的企业集团将继续由可控的和非可控的业务组成。芒格和我会根据一家公司持久的竞争优势，管理能力和特点，以及价格，将资金配置到我们认为最合理的地方。</p>

<p>　　如果这一战略不需要我们付出多少努力，那就更好了。与跳水比赛使用的计分系统不同，你在商业活动中不会因为有“难度”而得分。此外，正如罗纳德-里根告诫的那样：“据说努力工作不会导致死亡，但我要说为什么要冒这个险呢？”</p>

<p>　　家族的珠宝以及我们如何增加你的珠宝份额</p>

<p>　　在A-1页，我们列出了伯克希尔旗下的子公司，这些公司在去年年底雇佣了36万名员工。</p>

<p>　　您可以在本报告后面的10-K中阅读到更多关于这些控股公司的信息。我们主要的头寸集中在我们拥有少量股权，但不控股的公司，这些公司列在这封信的第7页。这部分也同样非常庞大和多样化。</p>

<p>　　然而，伯克希尔的大部分价值存在于四大业务，其中三大业务为我们的控股业务，我们仅持有第四大业务5.4%的股权。四大业务都是珠宝。</p>

<p>　　价值最大的是我们的财产/意外险业务，53年来一直是伯克希尔的核心业务。我们的保险家族在保险领域是独一无二的。它的负责人Ajit Jain在1986年加入了伯克希尔哈撒韦公司，他也是独一无二的。</p>

<p>　　总的来说，我们保险业务的运营资金远远超过其全球竞争对手。我们的财务实力，加上伯克希尔每年从其非保险业务中获得的巨额现金流，使我们的保险公司能安全地遵循以购买股票为主的投资策略，这对绝大多数保险公司来说是不可行的。那些保险公司，出于监管和信用评级的原因，必须以购买债券为主。</p>

<p>　　现在债券并不是好的投资标的。你能相信最近10年期美国国债的收益率是0.93%——比1981年9月的15.8%的收益率下降了94%吗？在某些重要的大国，如德国和日本，投资者从数万亿美元的主权债务中获得负回报。全球范围内的固定收益投资者——无论是养老基金、保险公司还是退休人员——都面临着暗淡的未来。</p>

<p>　　一些保险公司，以及其他债券投资者，可能会试图通过将购买转移到由不稳定的借款人支持的债券，来为目前可怜的回报提供动力。然而，高风险贷款并不是解决利率不足问题的办法。30年前，一度强大的储蓄和贷款行业毁了自己，部分原因是忽视了这条箴言。</p>

<p>　　伯克希尔现在拥有1380亿美元的保险“浮动”资金 —— 这些资金不属于我们，但我们可以配置，无论是配置债券、股票还是美国国库券等现金等价物。浮动资金与银行存款有一些相似之处：保险公司每天都有现金进进出出，但保险公司持有的现金总额变化很小。伯克希尔持有的巨额资产很可能会在未来许多年保持在目前的水平，而且从累计角度看对我们来说是没有成本的。当然，这个令人高兴的结果可能会改变 —— 但是，随着时间的推移，我会喜欢我们的胜算。</p>

<p>　　在我每年给你们的信中，我已经重复地 —— 有些人可能会说没完没了地 —— 解释了我们的保险业务。因此，今年我会请希望更多了解我们保险业务和“浮动资金”的新股东阅读2019年报告的相关部分，今年再次刊发在A-2页。重要的是您要了解我们从事保险业务所存在的风险和机会。</p>

<p>　　我们第二和第三大最有价值的资产是伯克希尔对以货运量计美国最大铁路公司BNSF的100%持股，以及我们对苹果公司5.4%的持股。排名第四的是我们持有91%的伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（BHE）。这是一个非常不同寻常的公用事业公司，在我们拥有它的21年里，它的年收入从1.22亿美元增长到了34亿美元。</p>

<p>　　关于BNSF和BHE在这封信后面我将做更多说明。然而，现在，我想把重点放在伯克希尔会定期使用的一种做法上，以提高你对它的“四大资产”以及伯克希尔拥有的许多其他资产的兴趣。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　去年，我们花247亿美元回购了相当于80，998股伯克希尔哈撒韦A股的股票，对伯克希尔的资产扩张表现出了热情。这一行动使你们在伯克希尔旗下所有企业的持股比例增加了5.2%，而你们根本不需要动用你们的钱包。</p>

<p>　　按照查理和我长期以来推荐的标准，我们进行了这些回购，因为我们相信，它们既能持续提高持股人的每股内在价值，也能让伯克希尔拥有充足的资金来应对可能遇到的任何机会或问题。</p>

<p>　　我们绝不认为伯克希尔的股票应该以任何价格回购。我之所以强调这一点，是因为美国的CEO们有过这样一个尴尬的记录：在股价上涨时，他们投入更多公司资金用于回购，而不是股价下跌时。我们的做法恰恰相反。</p>

<p>　　伯克希尔对苹果的投资生动地说明了回购的力量。我们从2016年末开始购买苹果股票，到2018年7月初，我们持有的苹果股票（经拆股调整后）略多于10亿股。说到这里，我指的是伯克希尔总账户中持有的投资，而不包括随后被出售的非常少的、单独管理的苹果股票。当我们在2018年年中完成购买时，伯克希尔的一般账户持有苹果5.2%的股份。</p>

<p>　　我们的投资成本是360亿美元。从那以后，我们都享受了定期股息，平均每年约7.75亿美元，而且在2020年，通过出售我们头寸的一小部分，我们还获得了额外的110亿美元。</p>

<p>　　尽管有出售 —— 你们瞧！ —— 伯克希尔目前仍持有苹果5.4%的股份。这一增长对我们来说是没有成本的，因为苹果一直在回购其股票，从而大幅减少了目前的流通股票数量。</p>

<p>　　但这远不是所有的好消息。因为我们还在两年半内回购了伯克希尔的股票，你现在间接拥有的苹果资产和未来收益比2018年7月整整多10%。</p>

<p>　　这种令人愉快的动态仍在继续。伯克希尔自去年底以来回购了更多股票，并且将来可能会进一步减少其股票数量。苹果也公开表示有意回购其股票。随着流通股的减少，伯克希尔的股东不仅将在我们的保险集团、BNSF（北伯林顿铁路公司）和BHE（伯克希尔·哈撒韦能源公司）中拥有更大的利益，而且还会发现他们对苹果的间接所有权也在增加。</p>

<p>　　回购的数学看似缓慢，但随着时间的推移会产生强大的力量。该过程为投资者提供了一种简单的方式，让他们拥有不断扩大的企业份额。正如性感女星梅·韦斯特（Mae West）向我们保证的那样： “太多的好东西都可以是美好的”。</p>

<p>　　<strong>投资</strong></p>

<p>　　下面我们列出了15笔年底市值最大的普通股投资。我们排除了卡夫亨氏的持股——325，442，152股——因为伯克希尔是一个控股集团的一部分，因此必须使用“权益”法来计算这笔投资。在伯克希尔的资产负债表上，卡夫亨氏持有的卡夫亨氏资产按公认会计准则计算为133亿美元，这一数字代表伯克希尔在2020年12月31日经审计的卡夫亨氏资产净值中所占的份额。但请注意，2020年12月31日我们这些股票的市值只有113亿美元。</p>

<p>　　<strong>双城记</strong></p>

<p>　　在美国，成功的故事俯拾皆是。自我们国家诞生以来，那些有理想、有抱负，但往往只有微薄资本的人，通过创造新东西或用旧东西改善顾客体验，取得了超出他们梦想的成功。</p>

<p>　　查理和我曾游历全美，与这些人或他们的家人相遇。在西海岸，我们从1972年收购喜诗糖果（See’s Candy）开始了这一惯例。整整一个世纪前，玛丽·时思（Mary See）开始推出一种古老的产品，她用特殊的配方对其进行了改造。除了她的商业计划之外，她还开设了一些古色古香的商店，里面有友好的销售人员。她在洛杉矶开的第一家小专卖店最终发展成了几百家商店，遍布整个西部。</p>

<p>　　今天，时思女士的作品继续令客户感到愉悦，同时为成千上万的男女提供终身就业机会。伯克希尔的工作就是不干涉公司的成功。当企业生产和分销一种非必需的消费品时，客户就是老板。而且，100年后，客户向伯克希尔传递的信息依然清晰：“不要乱动我的糖果。（喜诗糖果的网址是 https：//www.sees.com/，可以试试他们的花生糖。）</p>

<p>　　接下来让我们跨越大陆来到华盛顿特区。1936年，利奥·古德温和他的妻子莉莲开始相信，汽车保险——一种通常从代理商那里购买的标准化产品——可以直接以低得多的价格出售。两人怀揣10万美元，与拥有1000倍甚至更多资本的大型保险公司展开了较量。政府雇员保险公司（后来简称为GEICO）由此开始了其漫漫征程。</p>

<p>　　幸运的是，我在整整70年前就了解到了这家公司的潜力。它立刻成为了我的初恋（在投资方面）。接下来的故事大家都知道了：伯克希尔最终100%拥有了GEICO，这家84岁年历史公司一直在微调，但没有改变利奥和莉莲的愿景。</p>

<p>　　当然，该公司的规模发生了变化。1937年，也就是GEICO运营的第一个整年，其完成了238，288美元的业务。去年的数字是350亿美元。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　今天，沿海地区汇聚了大量金融、媒体、政府和科技机构，人们很容易忽视美国中部发生的很多奇迹。让我们关注两个社区，它们为我们全国各地的人才和雄心提供了令人惊叹的例证。</p>

<p>　　我从奥马哈开始，你们不会感到奇怪，</p>

<p>　　1940年，毕业于奥马哈中心高中（也是查理、我父亲、我第一任妻子、我们的三个孩子和两个孙儿的母校）的杰克·林格沃特（Jack Ringwalt）决定用12.5万美元的资本创办一家财产/意外伤害保险公司。</p>

<p>　　杰克的梦想似乎是荒谬的，因为这要求他的小公司——有点浮夸地被命名为国民保险公司（National Indemnity）——与大型保险公司竞争，而这些公司都拥有充足的资本。此外，这些竞争对手凭借遍布全国的、资金雄厚的、历史悠久的当地代理商网络而牢固地确立了自己的地位。</p>

<p>　　在杰克的计划中，与GEICO不同的是，国民保险公司本身会使用任何屈尊接受它的机构，因此在收购业务时没有成本优势。为了克服这些可怕的障碍，国民保险将重点放在了被大公司认为不重要的“古怪”风险上。不可思议的是，这一策略成功了。</p>

<p>　　杰克诚实、精明、讨人喜欢，还有点古怪。他尤其不喜欢监管机构。每当他对他们的监督感到厌烦时，他就会有卖掉公司的冲动。</p>

<p>　　幸运的是，有一次我就在附近。杰克想加入伯克希尔，于是我们在1967年达成了交易，只用了15分钟就达成了。我从没要求过审计。</p>

<p>　　今天，国民保险公司是世界上唯一一家愿意为某些巨大风险承保的公司。是的，它的总部仍然在奥马哈，距离伯克希尔的总部只有几英里。</p>

<p>　　多年来，我们又从奥马哈家族手中收购了四家企业，其中最著名的是内布拉斯加州家具市场（NFM）。该公司的创始人罗斯-布卢姆金（Rose Blumkin，B夫人）是俄罗斯移民，在1915年来到西雅图，她既不会读也不会说英语。几年后，她定居在奥马哈。在1936年，她攒下了2500美元，用这笔钱开了一家家具店。</p>

<p>　　竞争对手和供应商忽视了她，而他们的判断在当时无疑是正确的：第二次世界大战让她的生意停滞了。在1946年底，公司的净资产仅增长到72，264美元。现金，不论是在收银台里还是在存款里，总共是50美元（没有打错字）。</p>

<p>　　然而，有一笔无价的财富没有在1946年的数字中记录下来：B夫人唯一的儿子路易-布卢姆金（Louie Blumkin）在美国军队服役四年后重新加入了这家商店。在诺曼底登陆后，路易参加了诺曼底奥马哈海滩的战斗，并因在Bulge战役中受伤而获得了紫心勋章，最终在1945年11月乘船回国。</p>

<p>　　一旦B夫人和路易重聚，就没有什么能阻止这家家具店的发展了。在梦想的驱使下，母亲和儿子不分昼夜地工作。其结果是创造了零售业的一个奇迹。</p>

<p>　　到1983年，两人已经让家具店的业务规模达到了6000万美元。那一年，在我生日那天，伯克希尔收购了NFM 80%的股份。同样，我们没有对这家家具店进行审计。我指望布卢姆金的家族成员来经营企业。今天，NFM正由第三代和第四代布卢姆金的家族成员管理着。需要指出的是，B夫人每天都在工作，直到103岁——在查理和我看来，这是一个可笑的过早退休年龄。</p>

<p>　　NFM目前拥有美国最大的三家家居用品商店，尽管NFM的门店因新冠关闭了疫情六周多，但这三家商店在2020年都创下了销售记录。</p>

<p>　　这个故事的后记说明了一切：每当B夫人的一大家子人聚在一起过节吃饭时，她总是要求他们在吃饭前唱首歌。她的选择从未改变过：欧文-柏林（Irving Berlin）的《上帝保佑美国》（God Bless America）。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　让我们向东转移到田纳西州的第三大城市诺克斯维尔。在那里，伯克希尔拥有两家引人注目的公司——克莱顿住宅（Clayton Homes）（100%持股）和Pilot Travel Centers（目前持股38%，但到2023年将达到80%）。</p>

<p>　　每一家公司都是由一位毕业于田纳西大学并留在诺克斯维尔的年轻人创立的。这两个年轻人都没有足够的资金，父母也不富裕。</p>

<p>　　但是，那又怎样？如今，克莱顿和Pilot的每人的年税前利润都超过了10亿美元。这两家公司共雇用了大约4.7万名男女员工。</p>

<p>　　吉姆-克莱顿（Jim Clayton）在经历了几次商业冒险之后，于1956年以小本经营的方式创建了克莱顿住宅（Clayton Homes）。1958年，“大个子吉姆”（Big Jim Haslam）以6000美元的价格购买了一个服务站，创建了后来的Pilot Travel Centers。后来，他俩的儿子也都加入了他们的父亲的公司，他们的儿子有着和他们父亲一样的激情、价值观和头脑。有时候基因太有魔力了。</p>

<p>　　现年90岁的“大吉姆”Haslam最近写了一本鼓舞人心的书，他在书中讲述了Jim Clayton的儿子Kevin是如何鼓励Haslam家族将大部分的Pilot Travel Centers卖给伯克希尔的。每个零售商都知道满意的顾客是商店的最佳销售人员。当企业易手时也是如此。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　当您下次飞越诺克斯维尔或奥马哈时，向<em>Clayton</em>家族、Haslam家族和Blumkin家族，以及遍布全国各地的成功企业家们脱帽致敬吧。这些创造者需要美国的繁荣框架（它始于1789年进行的一次独特实验）才能发挥潜力。反过来，美国需要像这些杰出的公民来实现我们开国元勋所追求的奇迹。</p>

<p>　　如今，许多人在世界各地创造了类似的奇迹，创造了使全人类受益的繁荣。然而，在其短暂的232年中，还没有其他像美国这样可以释放人类潜能的孵化器。尽管出现了严重的中断，但我国的经济发展却令人叹为观止。</p>

<p>　　除此之外，我们保留着成为“更完美联盟”的宪政愿望。在这方面的进展缓慢，不平衡且经常令人沮丧。但是，我们已经向前迈进，并将继续前进。</p>

<p>　　我们坚定的结论：绝不与美国作对赌。</p>

<p>　　<strong>伯克希尔的伙伴关系</strong></p>

<p>　　伯克希尔是特拉华州的一家公司，我们的董事必须遵守该州的法律。其中包括要求董事会成员必须为公司及其股东的最佳利益行事。我们的董事们拥护这一原则。</p>

<p>　　此外，伯克希尔公司的董事当然希望公司能取悦客户，发展和奖励其36万名员工的才能，与放贷人的往来光明正大，并在许多我们运营业务的城市和州被视为良好公民。我们重视这四个重要的群体。</p>

<p>　　但这些团体中，没有任何一个团体在确定诸如股息、战略方向，首席执行官人选、并购和资产剥离之类的事情上有投票权。这些方面的责任完全是伯克希尔公司董事们的责任，他们必须忠实地代表公司及其所有者的长期利益。</p>

<p>　　除了法律要求之外，查理和我还对伯克希尔的许多个人股东负有一种特殊的义务。一些个人经历可能会帮助您了解我们不寻常的关系，以及它何影响我们的行为。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　在我执掌伯克希尔之前，我通过一系列合伙企业为许多个人管理资金，其中最早的3家合伙企业成立于1956年。随着时间的流逝，同时运营多个实体变得难以控制，在1962年，我们将12个合伙企业合并为一个独立的实体，即巴菲特合伙有限公司（Buffett Partnership Ltd．“ BPL”）。</p>

<p>　　到那一年，几乎所有我自己的钱，以及我妻子所有的钱，都一起投入了我的许多有限合伙公司的基金。我没有薪水，也没有费用收入。相反，作为普通合伙人，我的有限合伙公司只有在他们获得的年度回报率高于6%的门槛之后，才会给我报酬。如果收益未能达到该水平，差额部分就从我未来的应得利润中扣除。（幸运的是，从未发生过这种事：合伙人回报率总是超过6%的“标准杆”。）随着岁月的流逝，我父母、兄弟姐妹、姨妈姑婶、叔叔舅舅、表兄弟和姻亲都将大部分资金投资给了上述合伙企业。</p>

<p>　　查理在1962年成立了合伙公司，运作方式和我差不多。我们都没有任何机构投资者，我们的合作伙伴中也很少有金融行家。那些加入我们公司的人相信我们会像对待自己的钱一样对待他们的钱。这些人——要么凭直觉，要么依靠朋友们的建议——正确地得出了这样的结论：查理和我对资本的永久亏损有着极端的厌恶，除非我们预期他们的钱会做得相当不错，否则我们不会接受他们的钱。</p>

<p>　　1965年BPL收购伯克希尔哈撒韦的控制权后，我无意中进入了企业管理领域。后来，在1969年，我们决定解散BPL。年底后，这家合伙企业按比例分配了所有现金和三支股票，其中价值最高的是BPL在伯克希尔哈撒韦的70.5%股权。</p>

<p>　　与此同时，查理在1977年结束了其公司的运营。在他分配给合伙人的资产中，有Blue Chip Stamps的主要股份，这是他的合伙人、伯克希尔和我共同控制的一家公司。Blue Chip也是我的合伙公司解散时分配的三支股票之一。</p>

<p>　　1983年，伯克希尔和Blue Chip合并，使伯克希尔的注册股东基础从1900人扩大到2900人。查理和我希望所有人——新老股东和潜在股东——都能步调一致达成共识。</p>

<p>　　因此，在1983年的年报中——首当其冲——列出了伯克希尔的“主要商业原则”。第一条原则这样开始：“虽然我们的形式是公司，但我们的态度是合作关系。”“这定义了我们在1983年的关系，这样是我们对今天的定义。查理和我——以及我们的董事们——相信这句格言在未来几十年里将对伯克希尔大有裨益。</p>

<p>　　<strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong></p>

<p>　　伯克希尔的所有权现在分为五个大“桶”，其中一个由我作为“创始人”占据。那一桶肯定会空，因为我拥有的股票每年都会分配给各种慈善机构。</p>

<p>　　其余四桶中有两桶由机构投资者占据，各自负责管理他人的资金。然而，这就是这两个桶之间的不同之处：它们的投资程序截然不同。</p>

<p>　　一个机构类型是指数基金，这是投资界一个规模庞大、迅速发展的领域。这些基金只是紧跟它们追踪的指数。指数投资者最喜欢的是标普500指数（S&amp;P 500），伯克希尔哈撒韦是该指数的成份股。应该强调的是，指数基金之所以持有伯克希尔的股票，只是因为它们被要求这么做。他们处于自动驾驶状态，买卖只是为了“权重”目的。</p>

<p>　　另一个机构类型则是管理客户资金的专业人士，不管这些资金属于富人、大学、退休人员或任何人。这些职业经理人的职责是根据他们对估值和前景的判断，将资金从一项投资转移到另一项投资。这是一个光荣而艰难的职业。</p>

<p>　　我们很高兴为这个“活跃的”团体工作，同时他们也在寻找更好的地方来配置客户资金。可以肯定的是，一些基金经理着眼长远，很少进行交易。还有一些人使用计算机，利用算法可以在一纳秒内指导股票的买卖。一些专业投资者会根据他们的宏观经济判断来回操作。</p>

<p>　　第四类是个人股东，他们的运作方式与我刚才描述的积极型机构经理人类似。可以理解的是，当这些股东看到另一项令他们兴奋的投资时，他们会把自己持有的伯克希尔股票视为可能的资金来源。我们对这种态度没有异议，这与我们看待我们在伯克希尔持有的一些股票的方式类似。</p>

<p>　　综上所述，如果查理和我对我们的第五桶没有特别的亲缘感，那我们就没有人性了。第五桶就是超过百万的个人投资者，他们相信我们会代表他们的利益，不管未来会发生什么。他们加入我们并不打算离开，他们的心态与我们最初的合作伙伴相似。事实上，在我们合伙期间的许多投资者，以及/或他们的后代，仍然是伯克希尔的主要所有者。</p>

<p>　　斯坦·特鲁尔森（Stan Truhlsen）就是这些老合作伙伴中的一个典型代表，他是奥马哈市一位开朗慷慨的眼科医生，也是一位私人朋友，他在2020年11月13日迎来了自己的100岁生日。1959年，斯坦和其他10名年轻的奥马哈医生与我结成了伙伴关系。他们创造性地将自己的公司命名为Emdee， Ltd。每年，他们都会和我和妻子一起在家里举行庆祝晚餐。</p>

<p>　　当我们的合伙人在1969年分配伯克希尔股票时，所有的医生都保留了他们得到的股票。他们可能不知道投资或会计的来龙去脉，但他们知道在伯克希尔他们将被视为合伙人。</p>

<p>　　斯坦的两名来自Emdee的朋友现龄都90多岁了，他们仍然持有伯克希尔的股票。这一群体惊人的持久性——加上查理和我分别是97岁和90岁的事实——提出了一个有趣的问题：持有伯克希尔的股票会让人长寿吗？</p>

<p>　　* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>　　伯克希尔不同寻常且备受重视的个人股东家族，可能会让你更加理解我们不愿讨好华尔街分析师和机构投资者。我们已经有了我们想要的投资者，总的来说，我们不认为他们会被通过替代品来升级。</p>

<p>　　可供伯克希尔拥有的席位有限，也就是流通股。我们非常喜欢已经拥有了它们的人。</p>

<p>　　当然，“合伙人”也会发生一些变动。不过，查理和我希望这种变动很微小。毕竟，谁会寻求朋友、邻居或婚姻的快速转变呢？</p>

<p>　　1958年，菲尔·费舍尔写了一本关于投资的极好的书。在这篇文章中，他将经营一家上市公司比作经营一家餐厅。他说，如果你在寻找食客，无论是汉堡配可乐还是带有异国情调的葡萄酒配法国美食，你都可以吸引顾客并获得成功。但是，费雪警告说，你不能随意地从一个口味转换到另一个：你给潜在客户的信息必须与他们进入你的场所后发现的一致。</p>

<p>　　在伯克希尔，我们提供汉堡和可乐已经56年了。我们珍惜这一票价所吸引的顾客。</p>

<p>　　美国和其他地方的数千万其他投资者和投机者有各种各样的股票选择，以符合他们的口味。他们将会找到拥有诱人想法的首席执行官和市场专家。如果他们想要价格目标，管理收益和“故事”，他们不会缺少追求者。“技术人员”将充满信心地指导他们，告诉他们图表上的一些波动预示着股票的下一步走势。要求采取行动的呼声永远不会停止。</p>

<p>　　我要补充的是，这些投资者中的许多人会做得很好。毕竟，持有股票在很大程度上是一个“正和”博弈。事实上，一个耐心且头脑冷静的猴子，通过向标普500的上市公司投掷50支飞镖构建的投资组合，随着时间的推移，只要它不受诱惑改变原来的“选择”，它就将会享受股息和资本收益。</p>

<p>　　生产性资产，如农场、房地产，当然还有企业所有权，都能产生财富——大量的财富。大多数拥有这些资产的人都会得到回报。所需要的只是时间的流逝、内心的平和、充足的多元化以及交易和费用的最小化。不过，投资者决不能忘记，他们的支出就是华尔街的收入。而且，和我的猴子不一样，华尔街的人可不是为了花生而工作的。</p>

<p>　　当伯克希尔有空位时——我们希望这样的空位很少——我们希望它们能被那些了解并渴望我们所提供的东西的新来者所占据。经过几十年的管理，查理和我仍然不能承诺结果。然而，我们可以并确实保证将你们视为合作伙伴。</p>

<p>　　我们的后继者也会如此。</p>

<p>　　<strong>伯克希尔的一个可能令你吃惊的数字</strong></p>

<p>　　最近，我了解到一个我从未怀疑过的关于我们公司的事实：伯克希尔拥有的位于美国的房地产、工厂和设备——这类资产构成了我们国家的“商业基础设施”——它们的公认会计准则估值超过了任何其他美国公司所拥有的数量。伯克希尔的这些国内“固定资产”的折旧成本为1540亿美元。紧随其后的是AT&amp;T，其拥有的房地产、厂房和设备价值1270亿美元。</p>

<p>　　我应该补充一点，我们在固定资产所有权方面的领导地位，其本身并不意味着投资的胜利。最好的结果出现在那些只需要很少资产就能开展高利润业务的公司，以及那些提供只需要很少额外资本就能扩大销售额的产品或服务的公司。事实上，我们拥有一些这样的杰出企业，但他们相对较小，发展也比较缓慢。</p>

<p>　　然而，重资产的公司可以是很好的投资。事实上，我们很高兴看到我们的两大巨头——BNSF和BHE。2011年，也就是伯克希尔拥有BNSF的第一个整年，这两家公司的利润合计为42亿美元。2020年，对很多企业来说都是艰难的一年，但这两家公司却赚了83亿美元。</p>

<p>　　BNSF和BHE在未来几十年将需要大量的资本支出。好消息是，两者都可能带来适当的增量投资回报。</p>

<p>　　让我们先看看BNSF。它的铁路运输了美国境内所有非本地货物（按吨英里计算）的15%，无论是通过铁路、卡车、管道、驳船还是飞机。BNSF的负载远远超过任何其他承运人。</p>

<p>　　美国铁路的历史很有趣。在经历了150年左右的疯狂建设、欺诈、过度建设、破产、重组和合并之后，铁路行业终于在几十年前成熟并合理化了。</p>

<p>　　BNSF于1850年开始运营，在伊利诺伊州东北部修建了一条12英里长的线路。如今，BNSF有390个前身，他们的铁路被收购或合并。这家公司广泛的血统分布可以参看http://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf．</p>

<p>　　伯克希尔在2010年初收购了BNSF。自从被我们收购以来，这家铁路公司在固定资产上投资了410亿美元，超过了折旧费用200亿美元。铁路是一项户外运动，火车必须在极冷和极热的环境下可靠地行驶，因为它们总是会遇到从沙漠到山脉的各种地形。大规模洪水周期性发生。BNSF拥有23000英里的铁路，遍布28个州，必须不惜一切代价在其庞大的系统中最大限度地提高安全性和服务。</p>

<p>　　尽管如此，BNSF（北伯林顿铁路公司）还是向伯克希尔支付了大量股息——总计418亿美元。然而，铁路公司只会在满足其业务需求和保持20亿美元现金余额后，再付给我们剩下的钱。这种保守的政策允许BNSF以较低的利率借款，而不依赖伯克希尔对其债务的任何担保。</p>

<p>　　关于BNSF的另一个点是：去年，该公司首席执行官卡尔·艾尔（Carl Ice）和他的二号人物凯蒂•法默（Katie Farmer）在控制开支方面做了出色的工作，同时克服了业务的严重低迷。尽管载货量下降了7%，但这两位实际上使BNSF的利润率提高了2.9个百分点。卡尔如计划的那样，在年底退休了，凯蒂接任了首席执行官一职。因此，BNSF的管理依然优秀。</p>

<p>　　与BNSF不同的是，BHE（伯克希尔·哈撒韦能源公司）不支付普通股股息，这在电力行业很不常见。我们拥有该公司21年了，这种斯巴达式的政策贯穿了整个时期。与铁路不同，我们国家的电力设施需要大规模的改造，最终的成本是惊人的。这一努力将在未来几十年吸收BHE的全部收入。我们欢迎挑战，相信增加的投资将得到适当的回报。</p>

<p>　　让我来告诉你BHE的一项努力——它承诺投入180亿美元，对已经过时的电网进行改造和扩建，这些电网现在正在向整个西部输送电力。BHE在2006年开始这个项目，预计在2030年完成——是的，2030年。</p>

<p>　　可再生能源的出现使我们的项目成为社会的必需品。从历史上看，长期以来盛行的燃煤发电都位于人口密集的地区。然而，新世界风能和太阳能发电的最佳地点往往是在偏远地区。当BHE在2006年评估情况时，对西部输电线路进行巨额投资已不是什么秘密。然而，在计算项目成本后，当时很少有公司或政府机构有财力接手。</p>

<p>　　应该指出的是，BHE的决定是基于它对美国政治、经济和司法体系的信任。要获得可观的收入，需要投入数十亿美元。输电线路必须跨越各州和其他司法管辖区的边界，每个州都有自己的规则和选区。BHE还需要与数百名土地所有者打交道，并与生产可再生能源的供应商和向客户输送电力的遥远的公用事业公司签订复杂的合同。竞争激烈的利益集团和旧秩序的捍卫者，以及渴望立即出现一个新世界的不切实际的梦想家，都必须加入进来。</p>

<p>　　惊喜和延迟都是肯定的。然而，同样可以肯定的是，BHE具备管理才能、机构承诺和财力来履行其承诺。虽然我们的西部输电项目要多年才能完成，但我们今天正在寻找其他类似规模的项目来承担。</p>

<p>　　无论遇到何种障碍，BHE都将成为提供更清洁能源的领导者。</p>

<p>　　<strong>年度会议</strong></p>

<p>　　去年2月22日，我写信告诉你，我们计划召开一个盛大的年会。不到一个月，这个计划就被废弃了。</p>

<p>　　由梅丽莎·夏皮罗（Melissa Shapiro）和伯克希尔首席财务官马克·汉伯格（Marc Hamburg）领导的总部小组迅速重组。他们的即兴表演奇迹般地奏效了。伯克希尔副董事长之一格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）和我一起上台，面对着一个黑暗的舞台、1.8万个空座位和一台摄像机。没有彩排：我和格雷格在“表演时间”开始前45分钟到达。</p>

<p>　　我令人难以置信的助手Debbie Bosanek于47年前加入伯克希尔，当时她年仅17岁，她整理了约25张幻灯片，这些幻灯片展示了我在家中整理的各种事实和人物。幻灯片由一个匿名但非常能干的计算机和摄像头操作团队以适当的顺序投影到屏幕上。</p>

<p>　　雅虎将整个过程向创纪录的国际听众直播。CNBC的Becky Quick在新泽西州的家中工作，在Greg和我上台的四个小时内，从观众通过她的电子邮箱提交的成千上万个问题中挑选出问题。See’s花生脆和软糖，以及可口可乐，为我们提供食品。</p>

<p>　　今年，5月1日，我们计划举办一次更好的活动。同样，我们将依靠Yahoo和CNBC完美无缺的表现。雅虎将于美国东部时间下午1点开始直播。直播网址请登录 https：//finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream</p>

<p>　　我们的正式董事会议将于美东时间下午5：00开始，应在下午5：30结束。在此之前，在1：30-5：00之间，我们将回答Becky Quick转交的问题。和往常一样，我们不知道问题是什么。将您有趣的话发送到BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com。雅虎直播将在5：30之后结束。</p>

<p>　　现在——此处应有掌声——惊喜来了。今年，我们的会议将在洛杉矶举行……而查理将会上台，在整个3个半小时的问答环节中回答问题并发表意见。去年（他没来）我想念他，更重要的是，你们显然也想念他。我们宝贵的副主席Ajit Jain和Greg Abel也将与我们一起回答有关其业务领域的问题。</p>

<p>　　欢迎通过<em>Yahoo</em>观看我们的会议。将您真正棘手的问题转给查理！我们会很开心的，希望您也一样。</p>

<p>　　当然，更好的是我们面对面相见的那一天，我希望并期待能在2022年相见。奥马哈市民、我们的参展子公司以及我们所有在总部工作的人，都迫不及待地希望您参加真正的伯克希尔式大会。</p>

<h2 id="2020年股东信">2020年股东信</h2>

<p>2月22日，伯克希尔.哈撒韦公布了其2019年四季度及全年业绩报告，公司在四季度取得净利润291.59亿美元，较上年同期的亏损253.92美元实现扭亏。其中四季度取得投资收益245.27亿美元，相比去年同期为亏损276.13亿美元。</p>

<p>全年来看，伯克希尔.哈撒韦2019年全年取得净利润814.17亿美元，远高于2018年的40.21亿美元。其中A类普通股美股收益为49828美元，高于去年同期的2446美元；B类普通股每股收益33.22美元，上年同期为每股收益1.63美元。</p>

<p>与年报一同公布的则是股神巴菲特每年的惯例《致股东的公开信》，其中第一页仍然如往年一样对比伯克希尔.哈撒韦业绩与标准普尔500指数历年的表现。从1965年-2019年的55年间，伯克希尔.哈撒韦的年度复合增长为20.3%，而同期的标准普尔500指数的增速为10%；公司在历史总利得为2,744,062%，而标准普尔500指数则仅为19,784%。</p>

<p><img src="https://n.sinaimg.cn/spider2020223/629/w1399h1630/20200223/96c1-ipvnszf0984509.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>以下为巴菲特2020年致股东公开信全文翻译：</p>

<p>伯克希尔哈撒韦的各位股东：</p>

<p>伯克希尔2019财年基于通用会计准则（GAAP）的盈利为814亿美元。具体而言，这一总数当中包含240亿美元运营盈利，以及我们所持有股票产生的37亿美元已兑现资本利得和537亿美元的未兑现资本利得。前列所有均为税后数据。</p>

<p>关于这537亿美元利得，必须做一个补充说明。根据2018年生效的新版通用会计准则，一家企业所持有的证券，即便是尚未兑现的利得和亏损净变化也必须计入盈利数据。正如我们在去年股东信当中所澄清的，无论是我，还是和我一起管理伯克希尔的伙伴查理·芒格（Charlie Munger），我们对这种新规其实都持保留态度。</p>

<p>这种新规会被推出和采用，本质上说来，其实是标志着会计专业理念的一次重大改变。</p>

<p>2018年之前，通用会计准则坚持认为，除非一家企业的生意就是证券交易本身，不然的话，投资组合当中未兑现的资本利得任何时候都不该被计入盈利，而未兑现的亏损也只有在被认为是“非暂时性”的情况下才可以计入。现在，根据新规，伯克希尔必须将这些数据计入每个季度的盈利之中，不管这些证券的涨涨跌跌不管有多么起伏不定，可能会造成怎样的影响——对于众多投资者、分析师和评论家来说，这也成了他们必须掌握的新知识。</p>

<p>伯克希尔2018年和2019年的具体数据其实正清楚地证明了我们对新规的判断的正当性。正如我们发布的数据所显示的，2018年是股市遭遇不顺的一年，我们未兑现的利得缩减了206亿美元之多，于是我们当年度的通用会计准则盈利就只剩下了40亿美元。至于2019年，如前所述，由于股票价格的上涨，我们未兑现的利得猛增了537亿美元，使得通用会计准则盈利达到了前面所报告的814亿美元。换言之，股市行情的变化使得我们的通用会计准则盈利猛增了令人瞠目结舌的1900%！</p>

<p>然而，与会计世界不同的是，在我们认为的现实世界当中，伯克希尔所持有的股票总规模这两年一直保持在大约2000亿美元的水平，这些股票的内在价值也基本上都是在稳步而坚实地增长。</p>

<p>查理和我呼吁大家专注于运营盈利——我们的这一数据2019年较之前一年基本没有大的变化——同时不要去在意投资的季度或年度的利得或亏损，不管是已经兑现的还是尚未兑现的。</p>

<p>我们的这种建议绝不是忽视或贬低伯克希尔这些投资的价值。查理和我都预计，我们的股票投资，虽然其一时间表现出的具体形态可能难以预测，高度不规律，但是长期角度而言，注定会为我们创造巨大的利得。我们为何会如此乐观？下面的章节将会展开讨论。</p>

<p>保留盈利的力量</p>

<p>1924年，一位名声并不是那么显赫的经济学家、理财顾问埃德加·劳伦斯 ·史密斯（Edgar Lawrence Smith）完成了一本《普通股的长期投资》（CommonStocks as Long Term Investments），这虽然只是一本薄薄的册子，但是却改变了整个投资世界的面貌。事实上，撰写这本书的经历也改变了史密斯本人，迫使他开始重新评估自己的投资信条。</p>

<p>刚开始写作的时候，他最初想要说明的观点是，在通货膨胀周期当中，股票的表现要好于债券，而在通货紧缩周期当中，债券的回报则好过股票。看上去，这样的观点是合情合理的。可是接下来，史密斯自己都吃了一惊。</p>

<p>事实上，在这本书的最开头，史密斯就承认：“这些研究本身就是对失败的记录——事实并不能支持预设的观点。”然而，这却是投资者的幸事，因为失败迫使史密斯更加深入地思考，去探索到底该如何评估股票的价值。</p>

<p>要把握住史密斯到底洞见了些什么，我想最好还是引述一段关于他著作的最早期评论，来自约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）：“我一直读完全书，才大致搞清楚了史密斯先生最新奇的，当然也是最重要的观点到底是什么。</p>

<p>那些真正优秀的工业企业管理层是不会将他们每年所获的利润都全部派发给股东的，这是一个基本原则。</p>

<p>哪怕不是所有年景，至少在好的年景下，这些企业都会留下一部分利润，将其重新投入到其业务本身。这样就创造出一种有利于可靠的工业投资的复利运营模式。经年累月，这笔可靠的工业财富的真实价值就会以复利速度增长，更不必说股东们还得到了源源不断的股息。”</p>

<p>得到了这位经济学大家的加持，史密斯一夜成名。</p>

<p>在史密斯的这本著作出版之前，保留盈利的做法居然会让股东们都感到不满，这样的逻辑，今人已经很难理解了。毕竟，我们现在都知道，当年的卡耐基、洛克菲勒和福特等大家族之所以能够积累起令人瞠目结舌的巨大财富，靠的就是保留住很大一部分企业盈利，将其投入未来的成长，创造出更大的利润。事实上，不光是这些巨头们，在全美的范围内，真不知有多少具体而微的资本家们是靠着重复同样的剧本而发家致富的。</p>

<p>然而，事实就是，在史密斯之前的年代当中，当企业所有权被分割成无数小片——“股票”，后者的购买者们通常都将自己的投资视作是针对市场行情变动的短期赌博，往最好听里说也不过就是投机而已——真正的绅士们青睐的是债券。</p>

<p>不管投资者们变聪明的速度有多么迟缓，到今天，保留盈利用于再投资的数学公式都已经被大家充分理解了。曾经被凯恩斯评为“新奇”的观念，对于现在的高中生都已经是常识了——将储蓄和复利结合，就可以创造奇迹。</p>

<p>在伯克希尔，查理和我一直以来都高度重视有效地运用保留盈利。有些时候，这份工作其实是很轻松的，可是在另外一些时候，这份工作用“困难”来形容都嫌不足——尤其是我们面对着体量巨大，而且还在持续膨胀的现金的时候。</p>

<p>我们想要将自己所保留的这些资金投入使用，首选的目标就是投资于我们业已拥有的数量众多、种类繁杂的生意当中。单单在过去十年时间里，伯克希尔的折旧支出就累计达到650亿美元，而内部的地皮、厂房和设备投资累计更达到1210亿美元。再投资于运营资产永远都是我们的优先考虑对象。</p>

<p>此外，我们还在持续寻求买进新的企业的机会，只要后者能够符合三个标准。首先，他们运营的净有形资本必须能够创造得体的回报。其次，经理人必须是德才兼备，既有能力又诚实。最后，买进价格必须合理。</p>

<p>一旦我们找到了这样的企业，只要条件允许，我们都会希望将其100%全部收购下来。遗憾的是，符合我们前面全部要求的大规模收购机会其实颇为稀有。在更多的时候，我们还是只能去把握住股市波动当中涌现出的机会，去收购那些符合标准的上市公司的大量股份，但是往往并不能达到控股的程度。</p>

<p>无论我们到底是如何进行的投资——是控股了这些企业，还是只通过市场购入了一大笔股权——伯克希尔的财务表现很大程度上都将取决于我们所投资的这些企业的未来盈利能力。只不过，投资者必须明白，这两种投资方式在会计层面是存在着巨大差异的。</p>

<p>那些我们控股的企业（具体定义为伯克希尔持有50%以上股权），他们各自的盈利都会直接计入我们报告的运营盈利数据。各位看到的就是实实在在的盈利。</p>

<p>至于那些非控股企业，即我们拥有相当数量股票的企业，只有他们的股息才会被计入伯克希尔报告的运营盈利数据。当然，他们也会有自己的保留盈利，用来投入运转、创造更多附加值，但是这一切都不会从伯克希尔发布的盈利数据当中直接体现出来。</p>

<p>在几乎所有其他的大企业财报当中，投资者都不会看到伯克希尔这种高度重视和列出“未实现盈利”的做法。可是，对于我们而言，这却是一项非常重大，不容忽略的内容，必须详细列出如下。</p>

<p>以下，我们将列出我们通过股市投资的10支最重要成份股。</p>

<p><img src="https://n.sinaimg.cn/translate/543/w1398h745/20200223/5f34-ipvnszf0985164.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>显然，这些我们只是部分拥有的企业，我们最终能够记录下来的已兑现利得是不会与他们保留盈利当中根据“我们”持股比例计算出的结果准确对应的。虽然遗憾，但是也不能不承认，有些时候，保留盈利也可能会无功而返。只不过，不管是根据逻辑常识，还是根据我们过往的经验，我们都更加倾向于相信，这些企业和股票最终将实现的资本利得至少会与他们保留盈利当中属于我们的份额相当，很可能还会犹有过之。（需要补充的是，当我们最终卖掉这些股票，实现利得，我们必须按照当时的税率缴纳联邦所得税，目前的适用税率为21%。）</p>

<p>可以肯定地说，伯克希尔从这10家公司，以及我们做了股票投资的其他许多家公司所获取的回报未来还将以极不规则的形态持续呈现。有时可能是基于某家企业自身的问题，有时可能是因为股市大盘的缘故，亏损总会周期性发生。与此同时，在另外一些时间段当中，我们的利得则可能会爆炸式增长，比如去年就是个例子。整体而言，我们投资兑现的保留盈利对于伯克希尔自身价值的增长无疑是具有重大意义的。</p>

<p>史密斯完全正确。</p>

<p>非保险业务</p>

<p>汤姆·墨菲（Tom Murphy）是伯克希尔的重要董事，他是史上伟大的企业经理人之一。很早之前，他就给过我一些有关收购的重要建议：“要获得优秀经理人的美誉，只需确保你收购的是好企业即可。”</p>

<p>多年来，伯克希尔收购了许多公司，最初我全部将它们视为“好生意”。” 但是，最后有些公司却令人失望，有不少简直是彻底的灾难。另一方面，有不少公司却超出了我的期望。</p>

<p>回顾我时好时坏的投资记录时，我得出的结论是，收购就好比婚姻：当然，一开始婚姻是令人开心的，但随后，现实开始偏离婚前的期望。美妙的是，有些时候，新婚夫妇为双方带来了超出预期的幸福。而在另外一些情况下，幻灭也来得很快。将这些画面放到公司收购上面，我不得不说，一般是收购者遇到不愉快的意外情况。在追求收购的阶段，我们总是容易满眼乐观。</p>

<p>按照这种类比，我想说我们的“婚姻”记录大部分还算差强人意，各方皆大欢喜，都很满意很久之前所做的决定。我们的一些合作关系如同田园般惬意。但是，有不少情况，事后很快会使我很纳闷我在“求婚”（编者注：意指提出收购）时到底在想什么，才会做出当时的决定。</p>

<p>幸运的是，我的许多错误导致的后果因大多数令人失望的业务所具有的特点而有所减小：随着时间的流逝，“表现不佳”的公司趋于停滞，随即进入一种状态：即它们的业务对伯克希尔资本的需要占比越来越小。与此同时，“表现良好”的公司往往会继续增长，并以有吸引力的速度找到投资更多资本的机会。由于这两种截然相反的轨迹，伯克希尔的投资胜出者使用的资产逐渐成为我们总资本的一部分。</p>

<p>我们拿伯克希尔最初的纺织业务为例，这是金融运作的一个极端例子。我们于1965年初获得了该公司的控制权，而这个陷入困境的业务几乎需要伯克希尔的全部资本。因此，在一段时间内，伯克希尔的未盈利纺织资产给我们的总体回报拖了严重的后腿。好在最终我们收购了一批“表现良好”的企业，1980年代初的这一转变使得萎缩的纺织业务仅占去了我们一小部分资本。</p>

<p>如今，我们将你们的大部分资金投在能为运营所需的净有形资产带来良好乃至优异回报的可控制企业。我们的保险业务一直是佼佼者。这一业务具有特殊的特征，赋予其校准成功的独特指标，这是许多投资者不熟悉的。我们将在下一章节再作具体讨论。</p>

<p>在接下来的几段中，我们将各种非保险业务按收入规模分组（扣除利息、折旧、税项、非现金补偿、重组费用之后 –所有这些令人讨厌但非常实际的成本，公司的首席执行官们和华尔街有时会告诉投资者们不要理会）。你们可在K-6 – K-21和K-40 – K-52页上阅读有关这些业务的更多信息。</p>

<p>我们的BNSF铁路和伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（“ BHE”） – 伯克希尔非保险业务的两大领头羊– 2019年的共计收入83亿美元（仅纳入我们占BHE的91%份额），较2018年增长6%。</p>

<p>按照盈利排名（但下文中是按字母顺序排列的），接下来的五家非保险子公司ClaytonHome、International <em>MetalWorking</em>、Lubrizol、Marmon和PrecisionCastpart在2019年的总盈利为48亿美元，与它们在2018年的收入相比变化不大。</p>

<p>再下来的五家子公司（Berkshire Hathaway <em>Automotive</em>、Johns Manville、NetJets、Shaw和TTI，同样是按字母顺序排列的）2019年的总盈利为19亿美元，高于2018年的17亿美元。</p>

<p>伯克希尔拥有的其余非保险业务——此类业务有很多——2019年的总盈利为27亿美元，相比之下2018年为28亿美元。</p>

<p>2019年，我们控制的非保险业务净收入总额为177亿美元，较2018年的172亿美元增长了3%。收购和出售对这些结果几乎没有净影响。</p>

<p>我必须补充一点，强调伯克希尔公司的广泛业务范围。2011年，我们收购了总部位于俄亥俄州的Lubrizol公司，这是一家在全球范围内生产和销售石油添加剂的公司。2019 年9月26日，Lubrizol所属的一家法国大型工厂遭遇了一场大火。</p>

<p>这场大火造成了严重的财产损失，路博润的业务也因此遭到了严重破坏。即使如此，公司的财产损失和业务中断损失将通过路博润大量的保险追偿得到缓解。</p>

<p>但是，正如已故的保罗·哈维（Paul Harvey）在他著名的广播节目中所说的，“接下来是故事的结局。”</p>

<p>Lubrizol最大的保险公司之一是伯克希尔旗下的公司。</p>

<p>在马太福音6：3中，圣经指示我们：“你施舍的时候，不要让你的左手知道右手所做的。” 你们的董事长显然是遵照了圣经的嘱咐。</p>

<p>财产/意外险</p>

<p>1967年以来，财产/意外险（P/ C）业务一直是伯克希尔业绩增长的引擎。1967年，伯克希尔以860万美元收购了国民保险公司（National <em>Indemnity</em>）及其姊妹公司国民火灾及海事保险公司（National Fire＆<em>Marine</em>）。</p>

<p>如今，以净资产衡量，国民保险公司是世界上最大的财产/意外险公司。保险业务重在履行承诺，而伯克希尔履行承诺的能力是无人能比的。</p>

<p>我们被P / C业务吸引的原因之一是该行业的商业模式：P / C保险公司先收取保费后赔付。在极端情况下，一些理赔（如接触石棉，或严重的工作场所事故）的赔付可能持续数十年。</p>

<p>这种“先收取保费，后赔付”的模式让P / C公司持有大笔资金 - 我们称之为“浮存金” - 最终会赔付给其他人。与此同时，保险公司会将这笔浮存金拿去投资获利。虽然个人的保单和理赔来来去去，但保险公司持有的保费收入相关的浮存金一般较为稳定。因此，随着保险业务的增长，浮存金也随之增长。下表所示为浮存金的具体增长情况：</p>

<p><img src="https://n.sinaimg.cn/spider2020223/252/w1398h454/20200223/9cf5-ipvnszf0984578.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>我们偶尔也会遇到浮存金回落。如果浮存出现下滑，下滑幅度将是非常缓慢的- 单一年度最多不超过3%。我们的保险合同的性质决定了我们拥有的现金资源肯定可以满足短期或即时的偿付需求。这种结构是精心设计的，是我们保险公司无与伦比的财力的关键组成部分。这方面的能力绝不会受到冲击。</p>

<p>如果保费收入超过我们的费用和最终损失的总额，保险业务就实现承保利润，从而增加浮存金产生的投资收入。当赚得这样的利润时，我们就可以使用免费资金，而且更好的是，我们还会因为持有这些资金而获得回报。</p>

<p>对于整个财产与意外险行业而言，目前浮存金的财务价值远低于多年前。这是因为几乎所有财产与意外险企业的标准投资战略都严重且恰当地倾向于高级别债券。因此，利率变化对这些企业至关重要，而在过去十年里，债券市场提供的利率低得可怜。</p>

<p>由于保险公司年复一年地被迫（通过到期日或发行人赎回条款）将其“旧”投资组合转换成收益率更低的新持仓，所以保险公司也受到了影响。这些保险公司曾经可以安全地从每一美元的浮存金中赚取5美分或6美分，但现在他们只赚到2美分或3美分（如果他们的业务集中在深陷负利率泥潭的国家，甚至更少）。</p>

<p>一些保险公司可能会试图通过购买低质量债券或承诺高收益的非流动性“另类”投资来减少收入损失。但是，这些都是危险的游戏和活动，大多数机构都没有足够的装备参与这样的危险游戏和活动。</p>

<p>伯克希尔的情况总体上比保险公司要好。最重要的是，我们无与伦比的巨额资本、充裕的现金和多样化的非保险收入，使我们拥有比业内其他公司更大的投资灵活性。我们拥有很多选择，这些选择总是对我们很有利，有时会给我们提供重大的机会。</p>

<p>与此同时，我们的财产与意外险公司有着良好的承保记录。在过去的17年里，伯克希尔有16年实现了承保利润运营，只有2017年例外，当时我们的税前亏损高达32亿美元。在整整17年的时间里，我们的税前利润总计275亿美元，其中2019年实现了4亿美元。</p>

<p>这种记录并非偶然：严格的风险评估是我们保险经理日常关注的焦点，他们知道，糟糕的承保业绩可能会淹没浮存金的回报。所有保险公司都只是嘴上说说而已。</p>

<p>但在伯克希尔，这是一种宗教，旧约风格的宗教。</p>

<p>正如我过去一再做过的那样，我现在要强调的是，保险业的美好结局远非一件确定无疑的事情：在未来17年的16年里，我们几乎肯定不会获得承保利润。危险总是隐藏其中。</p>

<p>评估保险风险的错误可能是巨大的，可能需要很多年甚至几十年的时间才能显现和成熟。一场使卡特里娜飓风和迈克尔飓风相形见绌的大灾难将会发生，也许是明天，也许是几十年后。“最大的灾难”可能来自传统来源，如风或者地震，也可能是完全出乎意料的，比如网络攻击的灾难性后果超出了保险公司目前的预期。当这样的大灾难来袭时，伯克希尔就会得到它的损失份额，而且损失将会很大，非常大。然而，与许多其他保险公司不同，处理损失不会接近于耗尽我们的资源，我们将急于在第二天就增加我们的业务。</p>

<p>闭上眼睛，试着想象一个可能会产生动态财产与意外险保险公司的地方。纽约？伦敦？硅谷？</p>

<p>威尔克斯-巴里（Wilkes-Barre）怎么样？</p>

<p>2012年末，我们保险业务非常宝贵的经理阿吉特-杰恩（Ajit Jain）打电话告诉我，他将以2.21亿美元（约合当时公司的资产净值）的价格收购宾夕法尼亚州那个小城的一家小公司 - GUARD Insurance Group。他还说，GUARD首席执行官赛-福格尔（Sy <em>Foguel</em>）将成为伯克希尔的明星。GUARD和赛都是我的新名字。</p>

<p>转眼之间：2019年，GUARD的保费收入达到19亿美元，较2012年增长了379%，承保利润也令人满意。自从加入伯克希尔以来，赛带领公司进入了新产品和新地区，并将GUARD的浮存金增加了265%。</p>

<p>1967年，奥马哈似乎不太可能成为一个财产与意外险的巨头跳板。威尔克斯-巴里很可能会带来类似的惊喜。</p>

<p>伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司（Berkshire HathawayEnergy）</p>

<p>伯克希尔哈撒韦能源公司正在庆祝其在我们旗下的第20个年头。周年纪念日表明我们应该在赶超公司的成就。</p>

<p>我们就从电价这个话题开始。当伯克希尔在2000年进入公用事业领域时，它收购了BHE 76%的股份，该公司在爱荷华州的居民客户的平均千瓦时电价为8.8美分。</p>

<p>自那之后，居民客户的电价每年上涨不到1%，我们承诺，到2028年，基本电价不会上涨。相比之下，爱荷华州另一家大型投资公司的情况是：去年，该公司对居民客户收取的电价比BHE高出61%。最近，公用事业公司的费率上涨，将使这一差距扩大到70%。</p>

<p>我们和他们之间的巨大差异很大程度上是由于我们在将风能转化为电能方面取得的巨大成就。2021年，我们预计BHE在爱荷华州的运营将通过其拥有和运营的风力涡轮机产生约2520万兆瓦时的电力。这样的电力产量将完全满足其爱荷华州客户的年度需求，其约为2460万兆瓦时。换句话说，我们的公用事业公司将在爱荷华州实现风能自给自足。</p>

<p>与此形成鲜明对比的是，爱荷华州的另一家公用事业公司，风力发电不足总发电量的10%。此外，据我们所知，到2021年，无论在哪里，其他投资者拥有的公用事业公司都不可能实现风能自给自足。2000年，BHE服务于农业经济；如今，它的五大客户中有三个客户是高科技巨头。我认为，他们在爱荷华州建厂的决定部分是基于BHE提供可再生、低成本能源的能力。</p>

<p>当然，风是断断续续的，我们在爱荷华州的叶片只转动了部分时间。在某些时段，当空气静止时，我们依靠非风力发电的能力来保证我们所需的电力。在情况相反的时候，我们将风能提供给我们的多余电力卖给其他公用事业公司，通过所谓的“电网”为他们服务。我们卖给他们的电力替代了他们对碳资源的需求，比如煤或者天然气。</p>

<p>伯克希尔哈撒韦目前与小沃尔特-斯科特（Walter Scott, Jr.）和格雷格-阿贝尔（Greg Abel）共同持有BHE 91%的股份。自从我们收购以来，BHE从未向伯克希尔哈撒韦支付过股息，而且随着时间的流逝，BHE保留了280亿美元的盈利。这种模式在公用事业领域是个例外，公用事业公司通常会支付高额股息，有时甚至超过80%的盈利。我们的观点是：我们可以投资的越多，我们就越青睐它。</p>

<p>今天，BHE拥有运营人才和经验来管理真正的大型公用事业项目，这些项目需要1000亿美元或更多的投资，能够支持造福我们的国家、我们的社区和我们的股东的基础设施。</p>

<p>投资</p>

<p>以下所列出的是截至去年年底我们所持市值最大的15只普通股。在此，我们排除了卡夫亨氏的持股（325442152股），因为伯克希尔本身只是控股集团的一部分，所以必须用“股权”的方法来解释这笔投资。在伯克希尔的资产负债表上，若按通用会计准则计算，伯克希尔所持卡夫亨氏的股份价值138亿美元，相当于2019年12月31日伯克希尔在卡夫亨氏经审计的净值中所占份额。到去年年底，我们在卡夫亨氏的持股市值仅为105亿美元。</p>

<p>伯克希尔持股市值最大的15只股票（截止2019年12月31日）：</p>

<p><img src="https://n.sinaimg.cn/spider2020223/667/w1399h868/20200223/44da-ipvnszf0984942.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>* 不包括伯克希尔子公司的养老基金所持有的股份。</p>

<p>** 这是我们的实际购买价格，也是我们的计税基础。</p>

<p>***包括对西方石油公司数额为100亿美元的投资。这笔投资由优先股以及可购买普通股的认股权证组成。</p>

<p>查理和我都没有把以上这些股票（总计持股市值2480亿美元）当作是精心收集的潜力股。当前这场金融闹剧将要结束，因为“华尔街”的降级、美联储可能采取的行动、可能出现的政治动向、经济学家的预测，或者其他任何可能成为当前热门话题的东西，都将终止这场闹剧。</p>

<p>相反，我们把这些公司看作是一个我们进行部分持股的集合。若按加权计算，这些公司运营业务所需的有形净资产净利超过20%。这些公司不需要过度举债就可以盈利。</p>

<p>在任何情况下，那些规模巨大、成熟且易于理解的企业的订单回报率都是引人瞩目的。与很多投资者在过去十年里所接受的债券回报率（比如说30年期美国国债的收益率是2.5%或更低）相比，这些公司的回报率的确令人感到兴奋。</p>

<p>查理和我从来不喜欢玩预测利率的游戏，因为我们不知道未来一年、十年或三十年里利率的平均值是多少。我们或许有些偏见地认为，在这个话题上发表意见的权威人士，恰恰是通过这种行为，透露出的更多的是和他们自己有关的信息，而不是关于未来的信息。</p>

<p>我们可以说的是，如果在未来几十年里和当前利率接近的利率占上风，公司税也维持在企业当下正在享受着的低水平，那么几乎可以肯定的是，随着时间的推移，股票的表现将远远好于长期固定利率债务工具。</p>

<p>在给出这一乐观预测的同时，我们也要发出一项警告：未来股价可能会发生任何变化。有时，股市会暴跌，幅度可能是50%，也可能会更大。但是，对于那些不用借钱来炒股、且能够控制自己情绪的人来说，去年我曾在文章中写过的“美国经济顺风车”，再加上史密斯所谓的“复合奇迹”，会助推股票成为更好的长期选择。其他人呢？当心！</p>

<p>未来的路</p>

<p>30年前，我的朋友约瑟夫·罗森菲尔德（家住美国中西部），收到了当地一家报纸发来的一封信。这封信让罗森菲尔德很恼火，当时他已经80多岁了。报纸直截了当地要求乔提供一些生平数据，准备在他去世后用在他的讣告中。罗森菲尔德没有回信。接下来怎么样呢？1个月后，他收到了那家报纸发来的第二封信，而且还是封加急信。</p>

<p>查理和我很糟就已经进入了类似的“加急”阶段。对于我们来说，这显然不是什么喜讯。但是，伯克希尔的股东们不必焦虑：你的公司已经为我们的离开做好了百分百的准备。</p>

<p>我们之所以如此乐观，主要基于五大原因：</p>

<p>第一，伯克希尔的资产部署在各种各样的全资或部分拥有的企业身上，这些企业的资本回报率很吸引人。</p>

<p>第二，伯克希尔将旗下所控制业务定位在一个单一实体，这种现状赋予了该公司一些重要且持久的经济优势。</p>

<p>第三，伯克希尔将一如既往地以一种可让本公司抵御极端外部冲击的方式来管理财务事务。</p>

<p>第四，我们拥有经验丰富且忠心耿耿的顶尖经理人。对于他们来说，管理伯克希尔远远不止是一份高薪和/或有声望的工作。</p>

<p>第五，伯克希尔的董事们——你们的监护人——一直专注于股东的福利，以及培育一种在超大型企业中很罕见的文化。（拉里-坎宁安和斯蒂芬妮-古巴在合著的新书《信任的边缘》中探讨了这种文化的价值。在我们的年会上，可以看到这本书。）</p>

<p>还有一些特别实际的原因促使查理和我想要确保伯克希尔在我们离开后的日子里继续繁荣昌盛：芒格家族持有的伯克希尔股票规模，远超过该家族的其他投资；我高达99%的净身价靠的是伯克希尔股票。我从来没有卖过伯克希尔股票，以后也不打算这么做。</p>

<p>除了慈善捐赠和送人小礼物之外，我唯一一次动过伯克希尔股票，是在1980年。当年，我和其他被选出的伯克希尔股东们，用伯克希尔的一些股票换了伊利诺斯州一家银行的股票。早在1969年，伯克希尔收购了这家银行。1980年，因为银行控股公司法的变化，我们必须卸载该行。</p>

<p>今天，我在遗嘱中已经明确指明了执行人——以及在遗嘱关闭后接替他们管理我的遗产的受托人——不要出售伯克希尔股票。我的遗嘱还免除了遗嘱执行人和受托人的责任，因为他们要维持的显然是极度集中的资产。</p>

<p>根据我的遗嘱，执行人以及受托人每年会将我的一部分A股转换成B股，然后将B股分发给不同的基金会。这些基金会将被要求迅速分配所获得的捐款。总的来说，据我估算，在我去世12年-15年后我所持有的伯克希尔股票会进入市场。</p>

<p>没有我遗嘱的指令，直到安排好的分配日期之前，我所持有的所有伯克希尔股票应该不会易主。在安排好的日期，我的遗嘱执行人和受托人将会在他们的临时控制下出售伯克希尔股票，并且对到期的美国国债进行再投资。这样的策略将使受托人免受公众的批评，也免于因未能按照“谨慎的人”标准行事而承担个人责任的可能性。</p>

<p>我本人感到安心的是，在处置期内，伯克希尔的股票将可提供一种安全的、有回报的投资。也许会发生一些事件证明我是错的，这种可能性总是存在的——可能性不大，但也不能忽略不计。但我相信，与传统的行动方案相比，我的指示很可能会为社会提供更多的资源。</p>

<p>就我“只限伯克希尔”的指示而言，其关键在于我对伯克希尔的董事们未来的判断力和忠诚度抱有信心。他们经常都会面临华尔街人士的考验，与其争夺服务费。对许多公司来说，这些华尔街“超级销售员”可能会胜出。但我预计，在伯克希尔不会出现这种情况。</p>

<p>董事会</p>

<p>近年以来，企业董事会的构成及其宗旨都已成为人们关注的热点问题。在以前，有关董事会责任的争论在很大程度上仅限于在律师们之间展开；而在今天，机构投资者和政治家们也加入了进来。</p>

<p>就讨论企业治理的问题而言，我的资历包括，在过去62年时间里，我曾担任21家上市公司（详见下文横线以下部分）的董事。除了两家公司之外，我在其他公司中都持有并代表着大量股权。在少数公司中，我曾试图实施重要的改变。</p>

<p>在我服务于这些公司的最初30年左右的时间里，董事会中很少会有女性，除非她代表着企业的控股家族。应该指出的是，今年是第19修正案出台100周年，该修正案保障了美国妇女投票发声的权利。她们在董事会中获得类似地位的工作则仍在进行中。</p>

<p>多年以来，许多有关董事会组成和职责的新规则和指导方针已经出台。然而，董事们面临的根本挑战一如既往：找到并留住一位才华横溢的首席执行官——当然，还需要诚实正直的品质——并将自己的整个商业生涯都奉献给公司。通常情况下，这项任务是艰巨的。但是，一旦董事们做对这件事情，其他就什么都不用做了。但是，如果他们搞砸了这件事……</p>

<p>审计委员会会比以往更加努力地工作，并且几乎总是以严苛的态度看待这项工作。尽管如此，但是这些委员会的目标与管理者的期望不符，这实际上是一种“犯罪行为”，因为收益“指导”的祸害和首席执行官“达到预期数字”的愿望鼓励了这一行为。根据我与曾与公司数字CEO打交道的直接经验（谢天谢地，只是有限的经验）表明，更多情况下，他们通常是自我推动，而不是出于对经济利益的渴望。</p>

<p>薪酬委员会现在比以往更多地依赖顾问。因此，补偿安排变得更加复杂-哪个委员会成员能够解释为一个简单的计划年复一年地支付大笔费用？而且阅读代理材料已成为一种令人麻木的经历。</p>

<p>公司治理方面的一项非常重要的改进已得到授权：定期组织董事“执行会议”，禁止首席执行官参加。在此之前，很少有关于首席执行官的职能，收购决策和薪酬的坦率讨论。</p>

<p>收购提案对于董事会成员而言仍然是一个特别棘手的问题。进行交易的法律流程已得到完善和扩展（也恰当地描述了相关的费用）。但是我还没有看到渴望进行收购的首席执行官会招来一位熟悉内情且理智的批评家来反对他。是的，这一点也包括我在内。</p>

<p>伯克希尔、Blue Chip <em>Stamp</em>、Cap Cities-ABC、可口可乐、Data Documents、Dempster、General Growth、吉列、卡夫亨氏、<em>Maracaibo</em> Oil、Munsingears、奥马哈国民银行、Pinkerton’s、PortlandGas Light、所罗门公司、Sanborn Map、TribuneOil、美国航空、Vornado、华盛顿邮报公司、Wesco Financial。</p>

<p>总体而言，如今台面上摆满了首席执行官和他/她员工们喜闻乐见的交易方案。对于一家公司来说，聘请两名“专家”收购顾问（一名赞成，一名反对）向董事会传达他或她对拟议中交易的看法将是一项有趣的做法。比方说，最终意见获得采纳的顾问将获得另一位顾问酬劳的10倍作为奖励。但不要屏息等待这项改革（的到来）：当前的制度，无论对股东来说有什么缺点，对首席执行官和许多享受交易的顾问和其他专业人士来说都非常有效。当我们考虑到华尔街的建议时，一个古老的警告永远是正确的：不要问理发师你是否需要理发。</p>

<p>多年来，董事会“独立性”已成为一个新的值得关注的话题。然而，与这个话题相关的一个关键点几乎总是被忽视，那就是董事薪酬现在飙升到了一个水平，一个不可避免地使薪酬成为影响许多并不富裕董事成员潜意识行为的水平。试想一下，一位董事一年六次左右，花上几天“舒适”时间开董事会会议，收入就可以在25万至30万美元之间。通常，拥有一个这样董事职位人的收入是美国家庭年收入中位数的三到四倍（我曾错过了这样一个富足的机会：在20世纪60年代初，作为PortlandGas Light的董事，我每年的服务报酬为100美元。为了赚到这笔可观的收入，我每年需要往返缅因州四次）。</p>

<p>现在（董事）工作有保障吗？是的。董事会成员可能会被“礼貌地”忽视，但他们却很少被解雇。取代之的是，相当宽松的年龄限制（通常是70岁或更高）被视为是礼貌驱逐公司董事的标准行事方法。</p>

<p>难怪一位不富有的董事（non-<em>wealthy</em> director，简称“NWD”）现在希望、甚至渴望被邀请加入第二家公司的董事会，从而帮助自己跃升至50-60万美元的收入阶层。为了实现这一目标，NWD将需要一些帮助。一家寻找董事会成员的公司CEO几乎肯定会向NWD的现任CEO核实NWD是否是一个“好”董事。当然，所谓的“好”只是个暗号。如果NWD严重挑战他/她现任CEO的薪酬或收购梦想，他/她的（董事）候选人资格将悄无声息地抹去。在寻找董事时，首席执行官们并不是在寻找斗牛犬，只有可卡犬会被带回家。</p>

<p>尽管不合逻辑，但如今几乎所有董事都被归类为“独立（董事）”，然而许多拥有与公司兴衰密切相关的董事又被认为缺乏这一独立性。不久前，我查看了一家美国大公司的委托书材料，发现有8名董事从未用自己的钱购买过该公司股票（当然，他们得到了股票奖励，作为自己丰厚现金薪酬的补充）。这家公司长期以来一直（表现）落后，但董事们待遇却非常好。</p>

<p>当然，用自己的钱购买所有权并不能创造智慧，也不能确保商业成功。然而，当我们投资组合内公司的董事有用他们自己钱购买股票的经验，而不是简单地获赠时，我会感觉更好。</p>

<p>在这里，我应该停顿一下：我想让你知道，这些年来我见过的几乎所有董事都很像样、讨人喜欢且聪明。他们衣着光鲜，是好邻居、也是好公民，我很享受他们的陪伴。在这群人中，有一些人如果不是因为我们共同的董事会服务，我是不会认识他们的，他们如今已经成为了我亲密的朋友。</p>

<p>然而，这些善良的人中有许多是我永远不会选择来处理金钱或商业事务的人。因为这根本不是他们的游戏场。</p>

<p>反过来，他们也永远不会在拔牙、装修房子或改善高尔夫球技方面向我求助。此外，如果我被安排在“与星共舞”（<em>Dancing</em> With The Stars）节目中露面，我会立即寻求证人保护计划的庇护。我们总会在这件事或那件事上无所建树。对于我们大多数人来说，这个（无所建树的）清单很长。但需要认识到的重要一点是，如果你是鲍比·费舍尔（<em>Bobby</em> Fischer，美国国际象棋棋手），你必须为了钱而下棋。</p>

<p>在伯克希尔，我们将继续寻找精通商业的董事，他们以主人翁精神为导向，并对我们的公司有强烈的特定兴趣。思想和原则，而不是<a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/realstock/company/sz300024/nc.shtml">机器人</a>(10.220, -0.20, -1.92%)般的“流程”将指导他们的行动。当然，在代表你的利益（进行投资）时，他们会寻找用心取悦客户、珍惜自己同事、努力成为自己所在社区和国家好公民的经理人。</p>

<p>这些目标并不新鲜。这是60年前有能力CEO们的目标，现在仍是如此。否则又有谁该具备这些能力呢？</p>

<p>其他内容</p>

<p>在过去的报告中，我们已经讨论了股票回购的意义和无用性。我们的想法归结为：伯克希尔只有在以下情况下才会回购股票：a）查理和我认为它的售价低于其价值，以及b）公司在完成回购后，仍会拥有充足的现金。</p>

<p>（股票）内在价值的计算很不精确。因此，我们两人都没有对以非常真实的95美分购买估值为1美元的商品感到任何紧迫性，。2019年，伯克希尔的价格/价值等式有时是适度有利（股票回购）的，我们花了50亿美元回购了公司约1%的股份。</p>

<p>随着时间的推移，我们希望伯克希尔的股票数量下降。如果股价低于实际价值的情况（正如我们估计的那样）继续发生，我们很可能会在回购股票上变得更加积极。然而，我们不会在任何水平支撑股价。</p>

<p>持有价值至少2000万美元A类股或B类股，并有意向伯克希尔出售股票的股东可能希望他们的经纪人联系伯克希尔的马克·米勒德（Mark Millard），电话是402-346-1400。我们需要您在打定主意出售股票的情况下，在中部时间上午8：00-8：30或下午3：00-3：30之间给马克打电话。</p>

<p>2019年，伯克希尔向美国财政部汇出36亿美元，用于支付当前所得税。同期，美国政府收到了2430亿美元的企业所得税。从这些统计数据中，你可以为你的公司缴纳了美国所有公司缴纳联邦所得税的1.5%而感到自豪。</p>

<p>55年前，当伯克希尔进入当下的企业集团结构时，公司无需缴纳联邦所得税（这也是有充分理由的：因为在此前十年里，这家苦苦挣扎的企业录得净亏损）。从那时起，由于伯克希尔保留了几乎所有的收益，这项政策的受益者已不仅仅是公司股东，联邦政府也同样受益。（因为）在未来的大部分时间里，我们都希望并期待着向财政部上缴更大的金额。</p>

<p>在A-2-A-3页，您可以找到我们将于2020年5月2日举行年会的详细情况。像往常一样，雅虎将在全球范围内直播这一活动。然而，我们的形式将有一个重要的变化：股东、媒体和董事会成员建议，让我们的两位关键运营经理阿吉特·贾因（Ajit Jain）和格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）在年会上有更多的曝光率。这一变化非常有意义。无论是作为经理人还是个人，他们都是杰出的个体，你应该从他们那里听到更多。</p>

<p>今年发送问题给我们三名长期任职新闻人员的股东可以指定向阿吉特或格雷格提出问题。就像查理和我一样，他们也将完全不知道这些问题是什么。</p>

<p>记者将与观众轮流提问，观众也可以直接向我们四个人中的任何一个提问。所以，请擦亮你的獠牙。</p>

<p>今年5月2日，欢迎来奥马哈。在这里见见你的资本家同行，购买一些伯克希尔产品，尽情享受。查理和我，还有整个伯克希尔家庭都期待着见到你。</p>

<p>2020年2月22日</p>

INCREDIBLE FRIENDS.</p>

<p>147
00:13:58,671 –&gt; 00:14:03,475
WHEN YOU TALK TO WARREN BUFFETT,</p>

<p>148
00:14:00,940 –&gt; 00:14:06,211
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW CHARLIE</p>

<p>149
00:14:03,542 –&gt; 00:14:07,279
MUNGER MADE HIM A, QUOTE, BETTER</p>

<p>150
00:14:06,278 –&gt; 00:14:09,248
PERSON.</p>

<p>151
00:14:07,346 –&gt; 00:14:11,417
WHILE BUFFETT IS OFTEN VIEWED AS</p>

<p>152
00:14:09,315 –&gt; 00:14:12,818

DABBLE IN ARCHITECTURE.</p>

<p>158
00:14:20,959 –&gt; 00:14:24,229
I THINK THIS WILL BE A MOMENT</p>

<p>159
00:14:22,761 –&gt; 00:14:26,265
WHERE THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE</p>

<p>160
00:14:24,296 –&gt; 00:14:27,933
ATTENTION ON MUNGER.</p>

<p>161
00:14:26,332 –&gt; 00:14:31,537
HE’S 97 YEARS OLD.</p>

<p>162

<p>167
00:14:39,945 –&gt; 00:14:42,948
THIS YEAR.</p>

<p>168
00:14:40,679 –&gt; 00:14:48,586
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUFFETT</p>

<p>169
00:14:43,014 –&gt; 00:14:52,991
WAS IN THE CHI HELP ARENA AND</p>

<p>170
00:14:48,653 –&gt; 00:14:56,962
WITHOUT HIS LONG-TIME COLLEAGUE.</p>

<p>171
00:14:53,058 –&gt; 00:14:59,464
WE HAD A GREAT COLUMN FROM ANDY</p>

<p>172

THAT SEEMS TO BE GROWING.</p>

<p>175
00:15:02,601 –&gt; 00:15:05,971
I KNOW IT GREW IN THE QUARTER.</p>

<p>176
00:15:03,869 –&gt; 00:15:07,672
IF WE’LL GET ANY COLOR FROM THE</p>

<p>177

INVESTORS ON WHAT THEY’LL DO</p>

<p>178
00:15:07,739 –&gt; 00:15:10,409
WITH THAT.</p>

<p>179

<p>181
00:15:12,311 –&gt; 00:15:16,915
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT $155.4</p>

<p>182

BILLION IN CASH IN THE END OF</p>

<p>183

<p>184
00:15:18,851 –&gt; 00:15:23,221
WE’VE HEARD WARREN BUFFETT TAUT</p>

<p>185
00:15:22,187 –&gt; 00:15:25,123
THIS ACQUISITION.</p>

<p>186
00:15:23,288 –&gt; 00:15:27,292
LAST YEAR AT THE MEETING HE SAID</p>

<p>187
00:15:25,190 –&gt; 00:15:28,327
HE HASN’T DONE ANYTHING YET.</p>

<p>188
00:15:27,359 –&gt; 00:15:29,695
HE HASN’T FOUND ANYTHING THAT IS</p>

<p>189
00:15:28,394 –&gt; 00:15:31,563
THAT ATTRACTIVE.</p>

<p>190
00:15:29,762 –&gt; 00:15:33,265
I’D BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE’S</p>

<p>191
00:15:31,630 –&gt; 00:15:35,401
GOT HIS EYE ON SOMETHING NOW, IF</p>

<p>192
00:15:33,332 –&gt; 00:15:35,701
HIS THOUGHTS HAVE CHANGED ON</p>

<p>193
00:15:35,467 –&gt; 00:15:37,135
THAT FRONT.</p>

<p>194
00:15:35,768 –&gt; 00:15:38,603
IT WILL BE ALSO INTERESTING TO</p>

<p>195
00:15:37,202 –&gt; 00:15:39,504
SEE HOW HE’S VIEWING THE MARKET</p>

<p>196
00:15:38,670 –&gt; 00:15:42,140
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>197
00:15:39,571 –&gt; 00:15:43,208
REMEMBER A YEAR AGO HE MADE SOME</p>

<p>198
00:15:42,207 –&gt; 00:15:46,044
HEADLINES WHEN HE EXITED THOSE</p>

<p>199

MENTIONING HAVE BEEN ON MY MIND</p>

<p>239

<p>240
00:17:02,187 –&gt; 00:17:05,023
THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT.</p>

YOU KNOW, BUFFETT AND MUNGER</p>

<p>243
00:17:06,992 –&gt; 00:17:11,263
DON’T REALLY LIKE TO SPECULATE</p>

<p>244
00:17:09,694 –&gt; 00:17:13,298
WITH THEIR SHAREHOLDERS MONEY.</p>

<p>245
00:17:11,330 –&gt; 00:17:16,167
THE THING ABOUT WARREN BUFFETT,</p>

<p>246
00:17:13,365 –&gt; 00:17:18,303
HE DIDN’T STRIKE OIL OR DEVELOP</p>

<p>247
00:17:16,234 –&gt; 00:17:20,805
SOFTWARE AND INHERIT A BIG PILE</p>

<p>248
00:17:18,370 –&gt; 00:17:22,607
OF MONEY, HE BUILT HIS FORTUNE</p>

<p>249
00:17:20,872 –&gt; 00:17:24,209
BY PICKING SOLID BUSINESSES THAT</p>

<p>250
00:17:22,674 –&gt; 00:17:25,277
GENERATE A LOT OF CASH AND HE</p>

<p>251
00:17:24,276 –&gt; 00:17:25,644
BELIEVES WILL CONTINUE TO DO</p>

<p>252
00:17:25,344 –&gt; 00:17:27,612
WELL.</p>

<p>253
00:17:25,711 –&gt; 00:17:27,845
YOU KNOW, HE TAKES THE CASH FROM</p>

<p>254
00:17:27,679 –&gt; 00:17:30,015
THAT.</p>

<p>255
00:17:27,912 –&gt; 00:17:31,516
HE REINVESTS.</p>

<p>256
00:17:30,082 –&gt; 00:17:33,552
HE HOLDS ON FOR THE LONG TERM.</p>

<p>257
00:17:31,583 –&gt; 00:17:35,754
HE LOOKS FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES.</p>

<p>258
00:17:33,619 –&gt; 00:17:37,589
HE WANTS BUSINESSES THAT HE CAN</p>

<p>259
00:17:35,821 –&gt; 00:17:40,358
UNDERSTAND, WHICH IS A BIG PART</p>

<p>260
00:17:37,656 –&gt; 00:17:41,259
OF IT, THEN YOU CAN MORE</p>

<p>261
00:17:40,425 –&gt; 00:17:42,660
ACCURATELY VALUE A BUSINESS IF</p>

<p>262
00:17:41,326 –&gt; 00:17:44,262
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES.</p>

<p>263
00:17:42,727 –&gt; 00:17:47,165
HE WANTS BUSINESSES THAT HAVE</p>

<p>264
00:17:44,329 –&gt; 00:17:49,167
GOOD LONG-TERM PROSPECTS.</p>

<p>265
00:17:47,232 –&gt; 00:17:49,434
FEAR OF MISSING OUT IS HIS</p>

<p>266
00:17:49,234 –&gt; 00:17:50,902

HE WANTS BUSINESSES RUN BY</p>

<p>268
00:17:50,969 –&gt; 00:17:54,639
HONEST AND COMPETENT PEOPLE</p>

<p>269
00:17:52,270 –&gt; 00:17:57,275
BECAUSE THIS IS A LONG-TERM</p>

<p>270
00:17:54,706 –&gt; 00:17:58,776
RELATIONSHIP AND HE WANTS ALL OF</p>

<p>271

<p>272

YOU KNOW, HIGH QUALITY</p>

BUSINESSES LIKE THIS DON’T GO ON</p>

SALE VERY OFTEN BUT BUFFETT IS A</p>

EXACTLY THE RIGHT PITCH.</p>

<p>281
00:18:15,794 –&gt; 00:18:19,631
TO INCREASE HIS SUCCESS RATE HE</p>

<p>282
00:18:18,630 –&gt; 00:18:21,232
DOES LOOK FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE</p>

<p>283
00:18:19,698 –&gt; 00:18:23,468
SELLING FOR LESS THAN HIS</p>

<p>284
00:18:21,299 –&gt; 00:18:25,470
ESTIMATE OF THEIR FAIR VALUE</p>

<p>285
00:18:23,535 –&gt; 00:18:27,139
WHICH GIVES HIM SOME LEEWAY IN</p>

<p>286
00:18:25,537 –&gt; 00:18:27,739
CASE HIS ESTIMATE ISN’T EXACTLY</p>

<p>287
00:18:27,206 –&gt; 00:18:28,740
RIGHT.</p>

<p>288
00:18:27,806 –&gt; 00:18:30,608
BUT ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT</p>

<p>289
00:18:28,807 –&gt; 00:18:32,277
PART OF HIS STRATEGY IS LOOKING</p>

THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED</p>

<p>311

<p>512
00:28:47,091 –&gt; 00:28:50,728
THEN HE SAYS, LET ME FOCUS ON</p>

<p>513
00:28:49,660 –&gt; 00:28:51,695
NOT DOING THAT.</p>

<p>514
00:28:50,795 –&gt; 00:28:54,031
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AS A</p>

<p>515
00:28:51,762 –&gt; 00:28:56,300
TAKE AWAY FOR ANY INVESTOR,</p>

<p>516
00:28:54,098 –&gt; 00:28:58,770
THINK ABOUT THE WAYS MOST OF US</p>

<p>517
00:28:56,367 –&gt; 00:28:59,370
MESS UP AS INVESTORS.</p>

<p>518
00:28:58,837 –&gt; 00:29:00,838
WE’RE IMPATIENT.</p>

<p>519
00:28:59,437 –&gt; 00:29:02,807
WE TRY TO TIME THE MARKET.</p>

<p>520
00:29:00,905 –&gt; 00:29:03,107
WE SPECULATE ON THINGS WE DON’T</p>

<p>521
00:29:02,874 –&gt; 00:29:04,976
UNDERSTAND.</p>

<p>522
00:29:03,174 –&gt; 00:29:06,477
WE TRADE IN AND OUT.</p>

<p>523
00:29:05,043 –&gt; 00:29:08,112
WE’RE MUCH TOO EMOTIONAL.</p>

<p>524
00:29:06,543 –&gt; 00:29:10,248
WE GET CAUGHT UP IN FACTS.</p>

<p>525
00:29:08,179 –&gt; 00:29:12,383
HERE YOU HAVE CHARLIE AND WARREN</p>

<p>526
00:29:10,315 –&gt; 00:29:15,253
BASICALLY JUST AVOIDING ALL OF</p>

<p>527
00:29:12,450 –&gt; 00:29:17,221
THOSE STANDARD STUPIDITIES.</p>

<p>528
00:29:15,320 –&gt; 00:29:18,589
IT’S ACTUALLY EASIER TO AVOID</p>

<p>529
00:29:17,288 –&gt; 00:29:20,925
BEING STUPID THAN TO BE SMART.</p>

<p>530
00:29:18,656 –&gt; 00:29:22,426
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL</p>

<p>531
00:29:20,992 –&gt; 00:29:23,494
PARADOX THAT YOU HAVE THE</p>

<p>532
00:29:22,493 –&gt; 00:29:26,964
SMARTEST GIA LIVE JUST TRYING TO</p>

<p>533
00:29:23,560 –&gt; 00:29:29,667
BE SYSTEMATICALLY LESS STUPID.</p>

<p>535
00:29:29,734 –&gt; 00:29:33,304
ON THAT POINT.</p>

<p>536
00:29:31,035 –&gt; 00:29:35,106
WHEN CHARLIE AND WARREN TALK, IT</p>

<p>537
00:29:33,371 –&gt; 00:29:37,241
SOUNDS SO EASY AND YOU LISTEN TO</p>

<p>538
00:29:35,173 –&gt; 00:29:39,376
IT AND YOU GO, YUP, I’M GOING TO</p>

<p>539
00:29:37,308 –&gt; 00:29:41,445
DO THAT, I’M GOING TO DO THAT,</p>

<p>540
00:29:39,443 –&gt; 00:29:43,347
I’M GOING TO DO THAT AND THEN</p>

<p>541
00:29:41,512 –&gt; 00:29:43,614
YOU TRY TO DO IT, YOU CAN’T DO</p>

<p>542
00:29:43,414 –&gt; 00:29:46,684
IT.</p>

<p>543
00:29:43,681 –&gt; 00:29:48,619
WHY IS THERE THIS GAP?</p>

<p>544
00:29:46,751 –&gt; 00:29:51,255</p>

INVESTING, IT’S SIMPLE, NOT</p>

<p>546
00:29:51,322 –&gt; 00:29:52,857
EASY.</p>

<p>547
00:29:51,522 –&gt; 00:29:54,325
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO</p>

<p>548
00:29:52,924 –&gt; 00:29:55,993
UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE TO START BY</p>

<p>549
00:29:54,392 –&gt; 00:29:57,395
SAYING, WELL, THERE ARE THESE</p>

<p>550
00:29:56,060 –&gt; 00:29:59,297
PRINCIPLES BE THAT I NEED TO</p>

<p>551
00:29:57,462 –&gt; 00:30:00,097
UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW INVESTING</p>

<p>552
00:29:59,364 –&gt; 00:30:02,100
WORKS.</p>

<p>553
00:30:00,164 –&gt; 00:30:03,134
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WANT TO</p>

<p>554
00:30:02,166 –&gt; 00:30:05,069
BE PATIENT.</p>

<p>555
00:30:03,201 –&gt; 00:30:06,470
YOU WANT TO BUY ASSETS WHEN</p>

<p>556
00:30:05,136 –&gt; 00:30:08,105
THEY’RE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE</p>

<p>557
00:30:06,537 –&gt; 00:30:08,305
THAN THE MARKET THINKS THEY’RE</p>

<p>558
00:30:08,172 –&gt; 00:30:10,641
WORTH.</p>

<p>559
00:30:08,372 –&gt; 00:30:10,841
SO THERE’S A MARGIN OF SAFETY</p>

<p>560
00:30:10,708 –&gt; 00:30:12,109
THERE.</p>

<p>561
00:30:10,908 –&gt; 00:30:13,377
THEN THINK ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY</p>

<p>562
00:30:12,176 –&gt; 00:30:15,746
OF ACTUALLY BUYING THINGS THAT</p>

<p>563
00:30:13,444 –&gt; 00:30:17,982
ARE UNPOPULAR, THAT EVERYONE</p>

<p>564
00:30:15,813 –&gt; 00:30:20,651
ELSE THINKS ARE UNDER VALUED –</p>

<p>565
00:30:18,049 –&gt; 00:30:21,986
THAT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS ARE</p>

<p>566
00:30:20,718 –&gt; 00:30:22,653
ACTUALLY CHEAP BECAUSE THEY</p>

<p>567
00:30:22,053 –&gt; 00:30:25,222
DESERVE TO BE CHEAP.</p>

<p>568
00:30:22,720 –&gt; 00:30:26,290
I THINK THERE’S A TREMENDOUS</p>

<p>569
00:30:25,289 –&gt; 00:30:27,825
PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE.</p>

<p>570
00:30:26,357 –&gt; 00:30:30,127
WHEN I LOOK AT CHARLIE AND</p>

<p>571
00:30:27,892 –&gt; 00:30:31,529
WARREN, I THINK ONE OF THEIR</p>

<p>572
00:30:30,194 –&gt; 00:30:34,065
GREATEST ADVANTAGES IS JUST THAT</p>

<p>573
00:30:31,596 –&gt; 00:30:35,699
THEY’RE ENTIRELY UNEMOTIONAL.</p>

<p>574
00:30:34,132 –&gt; 00:30:37,068
THEY’RE NOT REALLY SUCKED UP BY</p>

<p>575
00:30:35,766 –&gt; 00:30:38,469
THE EMOTIONS OF THE CROWD.</p>

<p>576
00:30:37,135 –&gt; 00:30:40,137
WHEN I WENT TO INTERVIEW CHARLIE</p>

<p>577
00:30:38,536 –&gt; 00:30:42,106
I SAID TO HIM DURING THE MARKET</p>

<p>578
00:30:40,204 –&gt; 00:30:43,974
CRASH IN 2009 WHEN YOU WERE</p>

<p>579
00:30:42,173 –&gt; 00:30:46,543
BUYING THINGS LIKE WELLS FARGO</p>

<p>580
00:30:44,041 –&gt; 00:30:48,612
AT THE BOTTOM TICK OF THE CRASH</p>

<p>581
00:30:46,610 –&gt; 00:30:51,983
IN MARCH 2009, DID YOU FEEL</p>

<p>582
00:30:48,679 –&gt; 00:30:52,350
THESE EMOTIONS, LIKE FEAR,</p>

<p>583
00:30:52,050 –&gt; 00:30:54,418
ANXIETY, WORRY?</p>

<p>584
00:30:52,417 –&gt; 00:30:55,152
HE SAID, NO, I JUST DIDN’T FEEL</p>

<p>585
00:30:54,485 –&gt; 00:30:57,187
THEM AT ALL.</p>

<p>586
00:30:55,219 –&gt; 00:30:59,356
I SAID, DOES WARREN FEEL IT?</p>

<p>587
00:30:57,254 –&gt; 00:31:00,157
HE SAID, NO, HE’S WIRED EXACTLY</p>

<p>588
00:30:59,423 –&gt; 00:31:05,896
THE SAME WAY.</p>

<p>589
00:31:00,224 –&gt; 00:31:07,765
SO I THINK THERE’S A TREMENDOUS</p>

<p>590
00:31:05,963 –&gt; 00:31:13,170
TEMPERAMENTAL ADVANTAGE, WHICH</p>

<p>591
00:31:07,832 –&gt; 00:31:15,406
IS BECAUSE THEY DON’T FEEL THEM</p>

<p>592
00:31:13,237 –&gt; 00:31:17,241
AND EVERYONE IS SAYING, I CAN’T</p>

<p>593
00:31:15,473 –&gt; 00:31:19,110
BELIEVE THEY HAVE $145 BILLION</p>

<p>594
00:31:17,308 –&gt; 00:31:20,211
IN CASH AND THEY’RE NOT DOING</p>

<p>595
00:31:19,177 –&gt; 00:31:21,178
ANYTHING, WHY DON’T THEY DO</p>

<p>596
00:31:20,278 –&gt; 00:31:23,314
SOMETHING?</p>

<p>597
00:31:21,245 –&gt; 00:31:24,482
THEY’RE JUST SUBLIMELY</p>

<p>598
00:31:23,381 –&gt; 00:31:25,549
INDIFFERENT TO THE CRIES FROM</p>

<p>599
00:31:24,549 –&gt; 00:31:27,385
THE CROWD.</p>

<p>600
00:31:25,616 –&gt; 00:31:28,719
WARREN JUST SAID, WE’RE NOT PAID</p>

<p>601
00:31:27,452 –&gt; 00:31:29,520
FOR ACTIVITY, WE’RE PAID FOR</p>

<p>602
00:31:28,786 –&gt; 00:31:32,022

AWAY FROM ALL THE NOISE THAT’S</p>

<p>606

SIDE OF THE STREAM MOST OF THE</p>

IT DOESN’T ALWAYS HELP YOU.</p>

<p>673

THEM TOGETHER, HOW IMPORTANT IS</p>

<p>674
00:33:45,523 –&gt; 00:33:49,259
THAT PARTNERSHIP, DO YOU THINK?</p>

<p>675

JULIA LaROCHE IS TALKING ABOUT</p>

<p>677
00:33:51,129 –&gt; 00:33:56,500
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT TO ACHIEVE</p>

<p>678

ONE THAT HE HANGS OUT WITH IS</p>

<p>684

DARWIN.</p>

<p>685
00:34:11,048 –&gt; 00:34:14,318
WHAT HE LEARNED FROM DARWIN IS</p>

<p>686
00:34:12,449 –&gt; 00:34:14,585
DARWIN WAS SEEKING DISCONFIRMING</p>

<p>687
00:34:14,385 –&gt; 00:34:16,887
EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>688
00:34:14,652 –&gt; 00:34:18,489
HE WASN’T TRYING TO SUPPORT HIS</p>

<p>689
00:34:16,954 –&gt; 00:34:19,457
RELIGIOUS VIEWS WITH HIS</p>

<p>690

<p>691
00:34:19,524 –&gt; 00:34:23,694

MOST CHERISHED BELIEFS IN A</p>

<p>694
00:34:24,095 –&gt; 00:34:27,531
I THINK PART OF WHAT THIS</p>

<p>695
00:34:26,464 –&gt; 00:34:29,233
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARLIE AND</p>

<p>696
00:34:27,598 –&gt; 00:34:31,368
WARREN ENABLES THEM TO DO IS TO</p>

<p>697
00:34:29,300 –&gt; 00:34:33,837
TEST EACH OTHER’S BELIEFS.</p>

<p>698
00:34:31,435 –&gt; 00:34:36,707
WARREN FAMOUSLY HAS DESCRIBED</p>

<p>699
00:34:33,904 –&gt; 00:34:37,975
CHARLIE AS THE A BOMB MIN NABL</p>

<p>700
00:34:36,774 –&gt; 00:34:39,510
NO MAN.</p>

<p>701
00:34:38,042 –&gt; 00:34:41,011
TO HAVE THIS MECHANISM,</p>

<p>702
00:34:39,577 –&gt; 00:34:43,648
STRUCTURE WHERE SOMEBODY IS</p>

<p>703
00:34:41,078 –&gt; 00:34:44,314
CHALLENGING YOUR BELIEFS AND IS</p>

<p>704
00:34:43,714 –&gt; 00:34:48,185
SMART ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO</p>

<p>705
00:34:44,381 –&gt; 00:34:50,121
CHALLENGE YOU, I THINK THAT’S</p>

<p>706
00:34:48,252 –&gt; 00:34:54,625
HUGELY POWERFUL.</p>

<p>707
00:34:50,188 –&gt; 00:34:54,925
WE’RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT</p>

<p>708
00:34:54,692 –&gt; 00:34:57,027
OPPORTUNITY.</p>

<p>709
00:34:54,992 –&gt; 00:34:58,729
WE CAN BE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING</p>

<p>710
00:34:57,094 –&gt; 00:35:01,698
FOR DISCONFIRMING INFORMATION.</p>

<p>711
00:34:58,796 –&gt; 00:35:04,868
IF YOU’RE POLITICALLY LIBERAL</p>

<p>712
00:35:01,765 –&gt; 00:35:06,470
YOU READ “THE WALL STREET</p>

<p>713
00:35:04,935 –&gt; 00:35:09,340
JOURNAL” OP ED PAGE.</p>

<p>714
00:35:06,537 –&gt; 00:35:09,840
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CHARLIE</p>

<p>715
00:35:09,406 –&gt; 00:35:11,342
VERY CONSCIOUSLY DOES.</p>

<p>716
00:35:09,907 –&gt; 00:35:13,010
I THINK IT’S INTERESTING THAT</p>

<p>717
00:35:11,409 –&gt; 00:35:14,645
YOU HAVE WARREN AS A DEMOCRAT,</p>

<p>718
00:35:13,077 –&gt; 00:35:16,647
CHARLIE AS A REPUBLICAN, THEY’VE</p>

<p>719
00:35:14,712 –&gt; 00:35:17,781
HAD THIS KIND OF WONDERFUL</p>

<p>720
00:35:16,714 –&gt; 00:35:19,083
RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY’RE</p>

<p>721
00:35:17,848 –&gt; 00:35:20,251
ACTUALLY SEEKING OUT VIEWS THAT</p>

<p>722
00:35:19,150 –&gt; 00:35:22,085
ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN AND</p>

<p>723
00:35:20,318 –&gt; 00:35:23,987
THEN AT THE SAME TIME I THINK</p>

<p>724
00:35:22,152 –&gt; 00:35:28,392
TREATING EACH OTHER WITH</p>

<p>725
00:35:24,054 –&gt; 00:35:30,227
TREMENDOUS DECENCY AND KINDNESS.</p>

<p>726
00:35:28,459 –&gt; 00:35:31,428
I THINK THAT’S SOMETHING WE’RE</p>

<p>727
00:35:30,294 –&gt; 00:35:33,664
ALL EXCITED ABOUT.</p>

<p>728
00:35:31,495 –&gt; 00:35:34,331
IT’S IN A SENSE THE REUNION OF</p>

<p>729
00:35:33,731 –&gt; 00:35:36,400
THIS ODD COUPLE.</p>

<p>730
00:35:34,398 –&gt; 00:35:39,436
ON THE OCCASIONS THAT I’VE BEEN</p>

<p>731
00:35:36,467 –&gt; 00:35:40,871
TO OMAHA FOR THE BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>732
00:35:39,503 –&gt; 00:35:42,472
MEETING, ONE OF THE MOST JOYOUS</p>

<p>733
00:35:40,938 –&gt; 00:35:43,974
AND MEMORABLE THINGS, IT’S</p>

<p>734
00:35:42,539 –&gt; 00:35:46,143
ALMOST LIKE A COMEDY ACT.</p>

<p>735
00:35:44,041 –&gt; 00:35:50,447
IT’S AS IF YOU’RE WATCHING</p>

<p>736
00:35:46,210 –&gt; 00:35:51,649
WALTER MATTOW AND JACK LEMON</p>

<p>737
00:35:50,514 –&gt; 00:35:53,350
WISE CRACKING TOGETHER.</p>

<p>738
00:35:51,716 –&gt; 00:35:58,422
THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT</p>

<p>739
00:35:53,417 –&gt; 00:36:03,394
PARTNERSHIP AND THEN THE FACT</p>

<p>740
00:35:58,489 –&gt; 00:36:04,861
THEY TREAT THEM.</p>

<p>741
00:36:03,461 –&gt; 00:36:06,430
IT’S ONE OF THE REASONS WE’VE</p>

<p>742
00:36:04,928 –&gt; 00:36:08,966
ALL BEEN COMING BACK YEAR AFTER</p>

<p>743

IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO TALK</p>

<p>755
00:36:30,554 –&gt; 00:36:34,391
ABOUT CHOCOLATE.</p>

<p>756
00:36:31,756 –&gt; 00:36:36,527
IT IS THE ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD.</p>

<p>757
00:36:34,458 –&gt; 00:36:38,462

OF MY LIFE.</p>

<p>794
00:39:50,421 –&gt; 00:39:54,057
WE’VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.</p>

<p>795
00:39:51,989 –&gt; 00:39:55,225
LAST YEAR IT’S A TALE OF A</p>

<p>796
00:39:54,124 –&gt; 00:39:56,994
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT QUARTERS.</p>

<p>797
00:39:55,291 –&gt; 00:39:57,294
THE FIRST QUARTER WAS</p>

<p>798
00:39:57,061 –&gt; 00:39:58,929
TREMENDOUS.</p>

<p>799
00:39:57,361 –&gt; 00:40:00,897
WE STARTED OFF REALLY HOT AT THE</p>

<p>800
00:39:58,996 –&gt; 00:40:02,533
BEGINNING OF 2020 AND WE ENDED</p>

<p>801
00:40:00,964 –&gt; 00:40:04,368
PRETTY GOOD.</p>

<p>802
00:40:02,600 –&gt; 00:40:05,669
THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS WE</p>

<p>803
00:40:04,435 –&gt; 00:40:07,471
ESSENTIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF</p>

<p>804
00:40:05,736 –&gt; 00:40:09,306
MARCH WHEN THIS FIRST REALLY</p>

<p>805
00:40:07,538 –&gt; 00:40:11,141
HIT, WE SHUT DOWN ALL OF OUR</p>

<p>806
00:40:09,373 –&gt; 00:40:14,011
STORES IN THE SPAN OF FIVE DAYS.</p>

<p>807
00:40:11,208 –&gt; 00:40:15,745
SO ABOUT 245 STORES WE CLOSED IN</p>

<p>808
00:40:14,078 –&gt; 00:40:17,414
A MATTER OF DAYS AND THEN ABOUT</p>

<p>809
00:40:15,812 –&gt; 00:40:19,950
A WEEK AND A HALF LATER WE</p>

<p>810
00:40:17,481 –&gt; 00:40:21,552
CLOSED OUR eCOMMERCE FULFILLMENT</p>

<p>811
00:40:20,017 –&gt; 00:40:21,852
CENTER DOWN IN SOUTHERN</p>

<p>812
00:40:21,619 –&gt; 00:40:24,921
CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>813
00:40:21,919 –&gt; 00:40:26,089
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THERE WE</p>

<p>814
00:40:24,988 –&gt; 00:40:30,560
ESSENTIALLY COMPLETELY STOPPED</p>

<p>815
00:40:26,156 –&gt; 00:40:32,029
AND THE REASON FOR IT WAS WE</p>

<p>816
00:40:30,627 –&gt; 00:40:33,297
OPERATE AND ARE HEADQUARTERED IN</p>

<p>817
00:40:32,095 –&gt; 00:40:35,299
THE BAY AREA.</p>

<p>818
00:40:33,364 –&gt; 00:40:35,733
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ORDERS</p>

<p>819
00:40:35,366 –&gt; 00:40:37,767
ISSUED NATIONALLY.</p>

<p>820
00:40:35,799 –&gt; 00:40:39,569
AND SO WE RESPECTED AND STOPPED</p>

<p>821
00:40:37,834 –&gt; 00:40:41,805
AND THEN WE JUST – WE WENT</p>

<p>822
00:40:39,636 –&gt; 00:40:43,473
THROUGH ALL OF THE STATES THAT</p>

<p>823
00:40:41,872 –&gt; 00:40:44,208
WERE SUCCESSIVELY THAT WEEK</p>

<p>824
00:40:43,540 –&gt; 00:40:45,675
SHUTTING DOWN.</p>

<p>825
00:40:44,275 –&gt; 00:40:47,477
SO FROM THAT POINT FORWARD WHAT</p>

<p>826
00:40:45,742 –&gt; 00:40:49,679
WE DID WAS WE JUST SAID WE’RE</p>

<p>827
00:40:47,544 –&gt; 00:40:51,381
NOT GOING TO REOPEN STORES OR</p>

<p>828
00:40:49,746 –&gt; 00:40:53,216
REOPEN OUR PLANTS UNTIL WE CAN</p>

<p>829
00:40:51,448 –&gt; 00:40:54,885
CREATE A SAFE OPERATING</p>

<p>830
00:40:53,283 –&gt; 00:40:55,152
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF OUR</p>

<p>831

EMPLOYEES.</p>

<p>832
00:40:55,219 –&gt; 00:40:58,522
THAT TOOK A WHILE AND BY THE</p>

<p>833
00:40:56,987 –&gt; 00:41:00,790
TIME WE RESTORED AT THE END OF</p>

<p>834
00:40:58,588 –&gt; 00:41:02,225
THE SUMMER WE SAW CUSTOMERS</p>

<p>835
00:41:00,857 –&gt; 00:41:05,562
COMING BACK IN, BUT FOR THAT</p>

<p>836
00:41:02,292 –&gt; 00:41:05,795
PERIOD OF TIME, IT WAS PRETTY</p>

<p>837
00:41:05,629 –&gt; 00:41:07,364
ROUGH.</p>

<p>839
00:41:07,431 –&gt; 00:41:11,401
THINGS FOR YOU ALL?</p>

<p>840

HOW ARE YOUR STORE REOPENINGS?</p>

<p>841
00:41:11,468 –&gt; 00:41:16,072
I SUPPOSE YOU’RE PROBABLY DOING</p>

<p>842
00:41:13,770 –&gt; 00:41:19,577
A LOT OF BUSINESS ONLINE.</p>

<p>843
00:41:16,139 –&gt; 00:41:21,678
I KNOW AROUND VALENTINE’S DAY I</p>

<p>844
00:41:19,643 –&gt; 00:41:23,247
WAS LOOKING TO ORDER CANDIES FOR</p>

<p>845
00:41:21,745 –&gt; 00:41:23,580
SOME OF THE SPECIAL FOLKS IN MY</p>

<p>846
00:41:23,314 –&gt; 00:41:24,982

<p>847
00:41:23,647 –&gt; 00:41:26,817
HOW ARE THINGS NOW?</p>

JULIE.</p>

<p>850
00:41:27,284 –&gt; 00:41:29,753
IT’S GREAT.</p>

<p>851
00:41:28,118 –&gt; 00:41:31,421
WE’RE FULLY BACK, I BELIEVE.</p>

<p>852
00:41:29,820 –&gt; 00:41:32,656
WE’VE HAD OUR BEST JANUARY EVER,</p>

<p>853
00:41:31,488 –&gt; 00:41:35,359
OUR BEST FEBRUARY EVER.</p>

<p>854
00:41:32,723 –&gt; 00:41:35,893
WE JUST COMPLETED OUR BEST FIRST</p>

<p>855
00:41:35,426 –&gt; 00:41:38,562
QUARTER EVER.</p>

<p>856
00:41:35,960 –&gt; 00:41:39,997
AS YOU MENTIONED eCOMMERCE, WE</p>

<p>857
00:41:38,629 –&gt; 00:41:43,633
HAD A GREAT GROWTH LAST YEAR.</p>

<p>858
00:41:40,064 –&gt; 00:41:44,768
WE GREW 70% JUST IN LOOKING AT</p>

<p>859
00:41:43,700 –&gt; 00:41:46,336
TOTAL PACKAGES SHIPPED.</p>

<p>860
00:41:44,835 –&gt; 00:41:47,571
WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT WOULD BE</p>

<p>861
00:41:46,403 –&gt; 00:41:48,872
THAT WHEN THE STORES REOPENED,</p>

<p>862
00:41:47,638 –&gt; 00:41:49,406
THAT THAT WOULD TRAIL OFF A</p>

<p>863
00:41:48,939 –&gt; 00:41:50,441
LITTLE BIT.</p>

<p>864
00:41:49,473 –&gt; 00:41:54,144
IT HASN’T.</p>

<p>865
00:41:50,507 –&gt; 00:41:55,679
OUR FIRST QUARTER WE WERE UP</p>

<p>866
00:41:54,211 –&gt; 00:41:56,246
160% OVER THE FIRST QUARTER OF</p>

<p>867
00:41:55,746 –&gt; 00:41:58,415
LAST YEAR.</p>

<p>868
00:41:56,313 –&gt; 00:42:00,117
SO WHAT WE’VE SEEN IS THE</p>

<p>869
00:41:58,482 –&gt; 00:42:01,851
TRAFFIC COMING BACK INTO STORES.</p>

<p>870
00:42:00,184 –&gt; 00:42:03,620
IT’S BEEN GRADUAL, BUT WE’RE</p>

<p>871
00:42:01,918 –&gt; 00:42:05,188
ALMOST BACK TO 100%.</p>

<p>872
00:42:03,687 –&gt; 00:42:07,290
OUR eCOMMERCE, WHICH HAS MORE</p>

<p>873
00:42:05,255 –&gt; 00:42:08,625
THAN DOUBLED, HAS ACTUALLY</p>

<p>874
00:42:07,357 –&gt; 00:42:10,393
STAYED AT THAT LEVEL.</p>

<p>875
00:42:08,692 –&gt; 00:42:11,662
WE’RE JUST FINE WITH IT NOT</p>

<p>876

COMING BACK TO EARTH.</p>

<p>877
00:42:11,729 –&gt; 00:42:16,066
IT CREATES DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL</p>

<p>878
00:42:13,831 –&gt; 00:42:17,334
CHALLENGES BUT WE’VE DEFINITELY</p>

<p>879
00:42:16,133 –&gt; 00:42:22,306

BACKGROUND.</p>

<p>885
00:42:28,378 –&gt; 00:42:32,349
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED TO YOU</p>

<p>886
00:42:29,780 –&gt; 00:42:33,050
WAS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN</p>

<p>887

2019.</p>

<p>888
00:42:33,117 –&gt; 00:42:36,753
YOU WERE A FEW DAYS ON THE JOB,</p>

<p>889
00:42:34,518 –&gt; 00:42:38,121
A COUPLE OF YEARS ON THE JOB.</p>

<p>890

<p>896
00:42:44,895 –&gt; 00:42:48,432
AS YOU MENTIONED, OUR FOCUS ON</p>

<p>897
00:42:47,564 –&gt; 00:42:52,636
CUSTOMER SERVICE.</p>

<p>898
00:42:48,499 –&gt; 00:42:54,504
I FEEL SO FORTUNATE, I PINCH</p>

<p>899
00:42:52,703 –&gt; 00:42:55,472
MYSELF THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE</p>

<p>900
00:42:54,571 –&gt; 00:42:56,406
TREMENDOUS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE</p>

<p>901
00:42:55,539 –&gt; 00:42:58,475
IS AMAZING.</p>

<p>902
00:42:56,472 –&gt; 00:42:59,643
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN</p>

<p>903
00:42:58,542 –&gt; 00:43:01,111
CUSTOMERS COME INTO OUR STORE,</p>

<p>904
00:42:59,710 –&gt; 00:43:02,679
THAT THEY LEAVE WITH A SMILE AND</p>

<p>905
00:43:01,178 –&gt; 00:43:03,413
THAT THEY’RE HAPPIER THAN WHEN</p>

<p>906
00:43:02,746 –&gt; 00:43:05,616
THEY STARTED.</p>

<p>907
00:43:03,480 –&gt; 00:43:07,317
I LIKE TO SAY, WE SELL JOY.</p>

<p>908
00:43:05,683 –&gt; 00:43:07,951
 MY BACKGROUND IN ENERGY IS A</p>

<p>909
00:43:07,383 –&gt; 00:43:09,186
LITTLE DIFFERENT.</p>

<p>910
00:43:08,018 –&gt; 00:43:11,255
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>911
00:43:09,253 –&gt; 00:43:12,656
BUT I LEARNED SO MANY GOOD</p>

<p>912
00:43:11,321 –&gt; 00:43:14,224
LESSONS THERE THAT I HOPE HAVE</p>

<p>913
00:43:12,723 –&gt; 00:43:17,060
SERVED US WELL HERE, AND THAT IS</p>

<p>914
00:43:14,291 –&gt; 00:43:18,495
THAT IT’S NOT EASY TO MAKE AN</p>

<p>915
00:43:17,127 –&gt; 00:43:18,762
ENERGY CUSTOMER HAPPY ALL THE</p>

<p>916
00:43:18,562 –&gt; 00:43:20,097
TIME.</p>

<p>917
00:43:18,829 –&gt; 00:43:22,265
WHEN YOU’RE INTERACTING WITH</p>

<p>918
00:43:20,164 –&gt; 00:43:24,334
THEM, IT’S USUALLY ABOUT A BILL</p>

<p>919
00:43:22,332 –&gt; 00:43:25,669
OR YOU’VE HAD AN OUTAGE.</p>

<p>920
00:43:24,401 –&gt; 00:43:27,203
WE TRY TO MAKE BOTH OF THOSE</p>

<p>921
00:43:25,736 –&gt; 00:43:29,206
THINGS AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE,</p>

<p>922
00:43:27,270 –&gt; 00:43:32,042
BUT I REALLY WORK VERY HARD WITH</p>

<p>923
00:43:29,273 –&gt; 00:43:33,677
A GREAT TEAM THERE TO FOCUS ON</p>

<p>924
00:43:32,109 –&gt; 00:43:35,379
WHAT DOES THE CUSTOMER NEED?</p>

<p>925
00:43:33,744 –&gt; 00:43:35,546
I WILL SAY THAT IS THE BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>926
00:43:35,446 –&gt; 00:43:36,813
WAY.</p>

<p>927
00:43:35,612 –&gt; 00:43:38,748
THAT’S PART OF WHAT I’M PROUD</p>

<p>928
00:43:36,880 –&gt; 00:43:41,485
ABOUT AND I CAN SEE THE</p>

TRANSITION FROM ENERGY INTO</p>

WE TAKE CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS</p>

<p>1077
00:50:29,993 –&gt; 00:50:33,529
WELL.</p>

<p>1078

SOME OF THE RETAIL BUSINESSES,</p>

<p>1079
00:50:33,596 –&gt; 00:50:38,501
YOU KNOW, THEY WERE VERY</p>

INVESTED IN THE MALL ACCESS, I</p>

REMEMBER ABOUT THE LAST FOUR</p>

SUCCESSION PLANNING, AND I THINK</p>

<p>1146
00:52:40,190 –&gt; 00:52:44,260
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT</p>

<p>1147

WE HAVE TWO NEW VICE CHAIR MEN</p>

<p>1191
00:54:26,629 –&gt; 00:54:30,900

ABOUT SUCCESSION.</p>

AS I GO WITH THIS QUESTION.</p>

<p>1199

00:59:37,774 –&gt; 00:59:40,343
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STOCKS</p>

<p>1277
00:59:39,007 –&gt; 00:59:42,978
THAT ARE ON THE MARKET.</p>

<p>1278
00:59:40,410 –&gt; 00:59:43,779
WE CAN DEFINITELY FALL INTO WHAT</p>

<p>1279
00:59:43,045 –&gt; 00:59:45,081
IS TRENDY.</p>

<p>1280
00:59:43,846 –&gt; 00:59:46,715
WHAT ARE THE BUZZ WORDS.</p>

<p>1281
00:59:45,148 –&gt; 00:59:48,817
HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO BEING</p>

<p>1282
00:59:46,782 –&gt; 00:59:51,921
A SUCCESSFUL INVESTOR, WE HAVE</p>

<p>1283
00:59:48,884 –&gt; 00:59:53,355
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PULLING</p>

<p>1284
00:59:51,988 –&gt; 00:59:55,357
OURSELVES AWAY FROM THE CROWD</p>

<p>1285
00:59:53,422 –&gt; 00:59:57,259
AND INVESTING IN WHAT WE KNOW</p>

<p>1286
00:59:55,424 –&gt; 00:59:58,560
AND WHAT WE HAVE RESEARCHED.</p>

<p>1287
00:59:57,326 –&gt; 01:00:00,229
WHAT I’VE LEARNED FROM WARREN</p>

<p>1288
00:59:58,627 –&gt; 01:00:03,132
OVER THE YEARS IS TO MAKE SURE</p>

<p>1289
01:00:00,296 –&gt; 01:00:05,000
THAT I DO MY RESEARCH, AND IF I</p>

<p>1290
01:00:03,199 –&gt; 01:00:07,236
CANNOT UNDERSTAND A BUSINESS,</p>

<p>1291
01:00:05,067 –&gt; 01:00:09,705
THEN I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD NOT</p>

<p>1292
01:00:07,303 –&gt; 01:00:12,207
INVEST IN IT.</p>

<p>1293
01:00:09,772 –&gt; 01:00:13,275
AND WITH THAT BEING SAID,</p>

<p>1294
01:00:12,274 –&gt; 01:00:14,877
LOOKING AT STOCKS THAT I BELIEVE</p>

<p>1295
01:00:13,342 –&gt; 01:00:16,845
ARE UNDER PRICED BY THE MARKET</p>

<p>1296
01:00:14,944 –&gt; 01:00:20,649
AND THE ONES THAT I FEEL AS</p>

<p>1297
01:00:16,912 –&gt; 01:00:24,420
THOUGH THE PRICES WILL</p>

<p>1298
01:00:20,716 –&gt; 01:00:25,655
EVENTUALLY RISE SIGNIFICANTLY</p>

<p>1299
01:00:24,487 –&gt; 01:00:28,924
OVER TIME.</p>

<p>1300

<p>1301
01:00:28,991 –&gt; 01:00:30,660
GIRLS DO INVEST.</p>

<p>1302
01:00:29,959 –&gt; 01:00:32,227
WHAT IS THAT ORGANIZATION?</p>

<p>1303
01:00:30,727 –&gt; 01:00:32,862</p>

    <p>OH, MY GOODNESS, THANK YOU</p>

<p>1304
01:00:32,294 –&gt; 01:00:34,697
FOR ASKING.</p>

<p>1305
01:00:32,928 –&gt; 01:00:36,865
BROWN GIRLS DO INVEST IS A</p>

<p>1306
01:00:34,764 –&gt; 01:00:37,967
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, AND WE</p>

<p>1307
01:00:36,932 –&gt; 01:00:40,269
TEACH AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN HOW</p>

<p>1308
01:00:38,034 –&gt; 01:00:42,938
TO INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET,</p>

<p>1309
01:00:40,336 –&gt; 01:00:45,675
HOW TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE AS</p>

<p>1310
01:00:43,005 –&gt; 01:00:46,475
WELL AS ACQUIRE MULTIPLE STREAMS</p>

<p>1311
01:00:45,742 –&gt; 01:00:49,144
OF INCOME.</p>

<p>1312
01:00:46,542 –&gt; 01:00:50,379
WE BASICALLY FOLLOW WHAT WARREN</p>

<p>1313
01:00:49,211 –&gt; 01:00:51,380
BUFFETT TEACHES ABOUT, WHICH IS</p>

<p>1314
01:00:50,446 –&gt; 01:00:53,416
VALUE INVESTING.</p>

<p>1315
01:00:51,447 –&gt; 01:00:55,484
WE MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE</p>

<p>1316
01:00:53,483 –&gt; 01:00:57,186
INVESTING, IT’S FOR A LONG-TERM</p>

<p>1317
01:00:55,551 –&gt; 01:00:59,021
STRATEGY AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING</p>

<p>1318
01:00:57,253 –&gt; 01:01:00,155
SHORT TERM.</p>

<p>1319
01:00:59,088 –&gt; 01:01:01,790
THERE’S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT</p>

<p>1320
01:01:00,222 –&gt; 01:01:03,092
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY’RE</p>

<p>1321
01:01:01,857 –&gt; 01:01:05,961
EARNING MONEY AS QUICKLY AS</p>

<p>1322
01:01:03,159 –&gt; 01:01:08,063
POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, WE WANT TO</p>

<p>1323
01:01:06,028 –&gt; 01:01:09,498
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO</p>

<p>1324
01:01:08,130 –&gt; 01:01:11,300
UNDERSTAND THEIR RISK TOLERANCE</p>

<p>1325
01:01:09,565 –&gt; 01:01:14,703
BY ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS,</p>

<p>1326
01:01:11,367 –&gt; 01:01:15,371
DETERMINING THEIR AGE, AS WELL</p>

<p>1327
01:01:14,770 –&gt; 01:01:16,805
AS WHEN THEY’RE GOING TO RETIRE</p>

<p>1328
01:01:15,437 –&gt; 01:01:22,011
AND TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE</p>

<p>1329
01:01:16,872 –&gt; 01:01:23,679
BEST STRATEGIES IS TO HOLD ON AS</p>

<p>1330
01:01:22,078 –&gt; 01:01:24,714
WELL AS ADDRESS SOME OF THE</p>

<p>1331
01:01:23,746 –&gt; 01:01:26,482
INFLATION THAT IS GOING ON THAT</p>

<p>1332
01:01:24,780 –&gt; 01:01:27,349
IS NOT GOING TO BE CONDUCIVE TO</p>

<p>1333
01:01:26,549 –&gt; 01:01:29,585
OUR BUYING POWER.</p>

<p>1334
01:01:27,416 –&gt; 01:01:31,086
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WARREN</p>

<p>1335
01:01:29,652 –&gt; 01:01:32,421
BUFFETT DOES WITH HIS STRATEGY</p>

<p>1336
01:01:31,153 –&gt; 01:01:35,457
AS FAR AS BUY AND HOLD AND LOOK</p>

<p>1337
01:01:32,488 –&gt; 01:01:40,296
AT OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS HOW</p>

<p>1338
01:01:35,524 –&gt; 01:01:43,432
STOCKS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE</p>

<p>1339
01:01:40,363 –&gt; 01:01:43,733
EARNED 9.2%, YOU CANNOT GO</p>

<p>1340
01:01:43,499 –&gt; 01:01:45,367
WRONG.</p>

<p>1341
01:01:43,800 –&gt; 01:01:47,436
SO WITH BROWN GIRLS DO INVEST,</p>

<p>1342
01:01:45,434 –&gt; 01:01:50,005
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE EDUCATE ON</p>

<p>1343
01:01:47,503 –&gt; 01:01:50,238
HOW TO INVEST IN THE STOCK</p>

<p>1344

<p>1345

<p>1346
01:01:52,775 –&gt; 01:01:56,011
I KNOW WE’RE GOING TO HEAR FROM</p>

WARREN AND CHARLIE ABOUT TODAY,</p>

<p>1348
01:01:56,078 –&gt; 01:01:58,914
WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING WITH</p>

<p>1349
01:01:57,446 –&gt; 01:02:00,649
CRYPTO, THE MEME STOCKS.</p>

<p>1350
01:01:58,981 –&gt; 01:02:06,923
THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST</p>

<p>1351
01:02:00,716 –&gt; 01:02:07,689
ON THINGS LIKE ROBINHOOD.</p>

<p>1352
01:02:06,989 –&gt; 01:02:09,458
IT’S DRIVEN INTEREST IN STOCKS</p>

<p>1353
01:02:07,756 –&gt; 01:02:10,559
AND I’M SURE YOU’VE SEEN THAT IN</p>

<p>1354
01:02:09,525 –&gt; 01:02:11,960
YOUR WORK AS WELL.</p>

<p>1355
01:02:10,626 –&gt; 01:02:14,130
I’M CURIOUS HOW YOU’VE GONE</p>

<p>1356
01:02:12,027 –&gt; 01:02:16,265
ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE TRYING TO</p>

GET IN AND OUT ON A DAY’S BASIS,</p>

<p>1358
01:02:16,332 –&gt; 01:02:20,135
A WEEK OR A MONTH’S BASIS, THAT</p>

<p>1359
01:02:18,300 –&gt; 01:02:22,538
WILL LIKELY, LIKELY ERODE YOUR</p>

01:02:20,202 –&gt; 01:02:23,438
GAINS OVER TIME AND HOW THAT</p>

<p>1361
01:02:22,604 –&gt; 01:02:35,451
CONVERSATION HAS MAYBE CHANGED</p>

<p>1362

OVER THE LAST YEAR WHEN INTEREST</p>

IN THE STOCKS AND THE MARKET HAS</p>

<p>1364
01:02:37,153 –&gt; 01:02:38,387
GONE UP.</p>

    <p>THAT’S RIGHT.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>1366
01:02:38,454 –&gt; 01:02:41,223
DON’T ENGAGE IN THE BUZZ WORD.</p>

<p>1367
01:02:40,256 –&gt; 01:02:45,728
NOT TO DO WHAT YOU FEEL AS</p>

<p>1368
01:02:41,290 –&gt; 01:02:48,163
THOUGH YOUR NEIGHBOR IS DOING</p>

<p>1369
01:02:45,795 –&gt; 01:02:50,332
AND TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE</p>

<p>1370
01:02:48,230 –&gt; 01:02:50,599
INVESTING OFF OF YOUR INVESTMENT</p>

CRYPTOCURRENCY AND OTHER THINGS</p>

<p>1374

TO INVEST IN OVER THE YEARS, TO</p>

<p>1375
01:02:58,874 –&gt; 01:03:02,444
MAKE SURE WE TELL INVESTORS TO</p>

<p>1376
01:03:00,843 –&gt; 01:03:05,147
DO WHAT BUFFETT ENCOURAGES US TO</p>

<p>1377
01:03:02,511 –&gt; 01:03:05,380
DO, WHICH IS TO RESEARCH THE</p>

<p>1378
01:03:05,214 –&gt; 01:03:08,617
COMPANY.</p>

<p>1379
01:03:05,447 –&gt; 01:03:13,422
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE IN</p>

<p>1380
01:03:08,684 –&gt; 01:03:15,224
BUZZ WORDS OR STRTRENDY THINGS T</p>

ARE OCCURRING, YOU DO NOT HAVE</p>

TIME.</p>

<p>1383
01:03:15,491 –&gt; 01:03:18,794
IN ADDITION TO RESEARCHING THE</p>

<p>1384
01:03:17,493 –&gt; 01:03:20,295
COMPANY, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE</p>

<p>1385
01:03:18,861 –&gt; 01:03:21,964
WHATEVER YOU ARE INVESTING IN</p>

<p>1386
01:03:20,362 –&gt; 01:03:23,565
HAS A STRONG LEADERSHIP TEAM AS</p>

<p>1387
01:03:22,030 –&gt; 01:03:25,133
WELL AS ARE THEY PROFITABLE.</p>

<p>1388
01:03:23,632 –&gt; 01:03:26,668
LOOK AT THEIR PERFORMANCE AND</p>

<p>1389
01:03:25,200 –&gt; 01:03:30,039
THEIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND</p>

<p>1390
01:03:26,735 –&gt; 01:03:31,807
TRY TO AVOID OVER VALUED STOCKS.</p>

<p>1391
01:03:30,106 –&gt; 01:03:33,809
AGAIN, THE THING WITH INVESTING</p>

<p>1392
01:03:31,874 –&gt; 01:03:35,144
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE</p>

<p>1393
01:03:33,876 –&gt; 01:03:35,444
INVESTING LONG TERM, NOT</p>

<p>1394
01:03:35,211 –&gt; 01:03:36,745
TRADING.</p>

<p>1395
01:03:35,511 –&gt; 01:03:39,248
AND THAT’S SOMETHING THAT WE</p>

<p>1579
01:12:23,738 –&gt; 01:12:29,944
TIME A FEW MILES FROM HERE, AND</p>

<p>1580
01:12:27,476 –&gt; 01:12:30,679
62 YEARS LATER HE’S STILL LIVING</p>

<p>1581
01:12:30,011 –&gt; 01:12:31,747
IN THE SAME HOUSE.</p>

<p>1582
01:12:30,746 –&gt; 01:12:35,517
KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE I</p>

<p>1583
01:12:31,813 –&gt; 01:12:37,252
WAS BUYING A HOUSE JUST A FEW</p>

<p>1584
01:12:35,584 –&gt; 01:12:38,620
MONTHS BEFORE 62 YEARS AGO AND</p>

<p>1585
01:12:37,319 –&gt; 01:12:38,820
I’M STILL LIVING IN THE SAME</p>

<p>1586
01:12:38,687 –&gt; 01:12:41,489
HOUSE.</p>

<p>1587
01:12:38,887 –&gt; 01:12:43,425
SO YOU’VE GOT A COUPLE OF FAIRLY</p>

<p>1588
01:12:41,556 –&gt; 01:12:48,663
PECULIAR GUYS JUST TO START WITH</p>

<p>1589
01:12:43,492 –&gt; 01:12:51,266
IN TERMS OF THEIR LOVE AFFAIR</p>

<p>1590
01:12:48,730 –&gt; 01:12:56,505
WITH THEIR HOMES.</p>

<p>1591
01:12:51,333 –&gt; 01:12:58,039
AND CHARLIE – CHARLIE AND I HIT</p>

<p>1592
01:12:56,572 –&gt; 01:13:02,844
IT OFF IMMEDIATELY.</p>

<p>1593
01:12:58,106 –&gt; 01:13:04,446
I WOULD SAY HE’S – HE’S</p>

<p>1594
01:13:02,911 –&gt; 01:13:06,615
PROBABLY THE VICE CHAIRMAN IN</p>

<p>1595
01:13:04,513 –&gt; 01:13:08,683
CHARGE OF CULTURE, AMONG OTHER</p>

<p>1596
01:13:06,682 –&gt; 01:13:10,618
THINGS, BUT IF I EVER WANT TO</p>

<p>1597
01:13:08,750 –&gt; 01:13:12,921
GET QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE TRUE</p>

<p>1598
01:13:10,685 –&gt; 01:13:16,458
NORTH IS, I TALK TO CHARLIE AND</p>

<p>1599
01:13:12,988 –&gt; 01:13:18,460
HE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS HELP.</p>

<p>1600
01:13:16,525 –&gt; 01:13:20,262
HE’S DONE IT WITH A LOT FEWER</p>

<p>1601
01:13:18,527 –&gt; 01:13:22,197
HOURS AND A LOT LESS TALKING AND</p>

<p>1602
01:13:20,329 –&gt; 01:13:24,566
EVERYTHING THAT I’VE HAD, BUT</p>

<p>1603
01:13:22,264 –&gt; 01:13:26,134
HE’S CONTRIBUTED IN AN</p>

<p>1604
01:13:24,633 –&gt; 01:13:29,805
INCREDIBLE WAY TO BERKSHIRE.</p>

<p>1605
01:13:26,201 –&gt; 01:13:32,374
SO CHARLIE’S BEEN OUT HERE IN</p>

<p>1606
01:13:29,871 –&gt; 01:13:38,113
LOS ANGELES FOR 60 PLUS YEARS.</p>

<p>1607

01:14:02,471 –&gt; 01:14:10,645
SOMETIME AFTER HE GRADUATED FROM</p>

01:14:44,112 –&gt; 01:14:49,317
THERE.</p>

<p>1632
01:14:44,413 –&gt; 01:14:52,420
I MET AJIT ON A SATURDAY IN</p>

<p>1633
01:14:49,384 –&gt; 01:14:54,222
1986, AND I’VE BEEN IN THE</p>

<p>1634
01:14:52,487 –&gt; 01:14:55,190
INSURANCE BUSINESS – BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>1635
01:14:54,289 –&gt; 01:14:56,491
HAD BEEN IN THE INSURANCE</p>

<p>1636
01:14:55,257 –&gt; 01:14:58,326
BUSINESS FOR A WHILE.</p>

<p>1637
01:14:56,558 –&gt; 01:14:59,528
I WAS STUMBLING AROUND IN A</p>

<p>1638
01:14:58,393 –&gt; 01:15:01,229
NUMBER OF WAYS.</p>

<p>1639
01:14:59,595 –&gt; 01:15:03,298
AJIT CAME INTO THE OFFICE.</p>

<p>1640
01:15:01,296 –&gt; 01:15:06,334
SATURDAY I WAS OPENING THE MAIL.</p>

<p>1641
01:15:03,365 –&gt; 01:15:08,069
I SAID, YOU KNOW, ABOUT</p>

<p>1642
01:15:06,401 –&gt; 01:15:11,339
INSURANCE AND HE SAID, NOTHING.</p>

<p>1643
01:15:08,136 –&gt; 01:15:13,975
I SAID, WELL, NOBODY’S PERFECT.</p>

<p>1644
01:15:11,406 –&gt; 01:15:15,443
LET’S TALK ABOUT IT SOME.</p>

<p>1645
01:15:14,042 –&gt; 01:15:18,513
AND BY THE END OF THE MORNING I</p>

<p>1646
01:15:15,510 –&gt; 01:15:21,249
KNEW I HAD SOMEBODY THAT WAS</p>

<p>1647
01:15:18,580 –&gt; 01:15:23,118
GOING TO BUILD A GREAT INSURANCE</p>

<p>1648
01:15:21,316 –&gt; 01:15:25,754
BUSINESS, AND STARTING FROM THAT</p>

<p>1649
01:15:23,185 –&gt; 01:15:29,657
POINT THIS IMPROBABLE LITTLE</p>

<p>1650
01:15:25,821 –&gt; 01:15:31,526
COMPANY IN OMAHA BECAME THE</p>

<p>1651
01:15:29,724 –&gt; 01:15:33,695
LARGEST PROPERTY CASUALTY</p>

<p>1652
01:15:31,593 –&gt; 01:15:33,928
COMPANY IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF</p>

<p>1653
01:15:33,762 –&gt; 01:15:36,197
NETWORK.</p>

<p>1654
01:15:33,995 –&gt; 01:15:38,767
IT WRITES RISKS THAT – IT</p>

<p>1655
01:15:36,264 –&gt; 01:15:42,437
WRITES RISKS OCCASIONALLY AND IN</p>

<p>1656
01:15:38,834 –&gt; 01:15:43,104
A 24-HOUR PERIOD THAT OTHER</p>

<p>1657
01:15:42,504 –&gt; 01:15:44,172
COMPANIES SIMPLY COULDN’T TAKE</p>

<p>1658
01:15:43,171 –&gt; 01:15:46,141
ON THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>1659
01:15:44,239 –&gt; 01:15:47,742
THEY’D HAVE TO ASSEMBLE OTHER</p>

<p>1660
01:15:46,208 –&gt; 01:15:51,613
PEOPLE AND IT WOULD TAKE THEM A</p>

<p>1661
01:15:47,809 –&gt; 01:15:52,547
LONG TIME TO COME TO A DECISION.</p>

<p>1662
01:15:51,680 –&gt; 01:15:53,248
THAT WAS VARIOUS AT OTHER TIMES</p>

<p>1663
01:15:52,614 –&gt; 01:15:54,849
IN THE PAST.</p>

<p>1664
01:15:53,315 –&gt; 01:15:57,586
NOT SO IMPORTANT NOW.</p>

<p>1665
01:15:54,916 –&gt; 01:15:59,020
HE’S BUILT AN INCREDIBLE – THE</p>

<p>1666
01:15:57,653 –&gt; 01:16:00,355
WORLD’S LEADING PROPERTY AND</p>

<p>1667

WE’VE GOT AJIT FROM INDIA AND</p>

<p>1672
01:16:12,033 –&gt; 01:16:22,010
THE ONE THING IN COMMON THAT</p>

<p>1673
01:16:16,071 –&gt; 01:16:22,344

ANOTHER THEY LIVED WITHIN A MILE</p>

<p>1678
01:16:28,950 –&gt; 01:16:38,159
OF ME IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA.</p>

<p>1679
01:16:31,887 –&gt; 01:16:40,862
AND CHARLIE IN 1934 MOVED ABOUT</p>

<p>1680
01:16:38,226 –&gt; 01:16:43,498
100 YARDS AWAY FROM WHERE I NOW</p>

<p>1681
01:16:40,929 –&gt; 01:16:45,700
LIVED AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL,</p>

<p>1682
01:16:43,565 –&gt; 01:16:46,901
EVENTUALLY WENT INTO THE SERVICE</p>

<p>1683
01:16:45,767 –&gt; 01:16:51,206
AND KNOWS THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS</p>

<p>1684
01:16:46,968 –&gt; 01:16:52,640
WELL AS I DO.</p>

<p>1685
01:16:51,273 –&gt; 01:16:58,713
WENT TO THE SAME GRADE SCHOOL MY</p>

<p>1686
01:16:52,707 –&gt; 01:17:02,517
KIDS WENT TO AND SO ON.</p>

<p>1687
01:16:58,780 –&gt; 01:17:04,152
GREG SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME IN</p>

<p>1688
01:17:02,584 –&gt; 01:17:06,788
LIVING IN OMAHA.</p>

<p>1689
01:17:04,219 –&gt; 01:17:10,959
LIVED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX BLOCKS</p>

<p>1690
01:17:06,855 –&gt; 01:17:11,226
FROM ME AND NOW LIVES IN DES</p>

<p>1691
01:17:11,026 –&gt; 01:17:13,594
MOINES.</p>

<p>1692
01:17:11,293 –&gt; 01:17:17,065
AND AJIT WAS IN OMAHA, ABOUT A</p>

<p>1693
01:17:13,661 –&gt; 01:17:17,265
MILE AWAY, FOR A COUPLE OF</p>

<p>1694
01:17:17,132 –&gt; 01:17:19,400
YEARS.</p>

<p>1695
01:17:17,332 –&gt; 01:17:22,337
SO WE STARTED IN VERY DIFFERENT</p>

<p>1696
01:17:19,467 –&gt; 01:17:23,905
PLACES AND SORT OF CAME TOGETHER</p>

<p>1697
01:17:22,404 –&gt; 01:17:28,743
AND NOW GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS,</p>

<p>1698
01:17:23,972 –&gt; 01:17:31,680
BUT IT’S ALL WORKED VERY WELL.</p>

<p>1699
01:17:28,810 –&gt; 01:17:31,946
I WOULD – AND YOU’LL HEAR FROM</p>

<p>1700

<p>1733
01:18:44,986 –&gt; 01:18:50,859

<p>1734
01:18:47,555 –&gt; 01:18:54,429
INTO THE DETAILS AND YOU WANT TO</p>

<p>1735
01:18:50,926 –&gt; 01:18:56,998
UNDERSTAND THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF</p>

<p>1736
01:18:54,496 –&gt; 01:19:00,335
THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS, YOU</p>

<p>1737
01:18:57,065 –&gt; 01:19:03,371
SHOULD READ THAT 10Q.</p>

<p>1738
01:19:00,402 –&gt; 01:19:04,439
IT WILL TAKE YOU – IT MAY TAKE</p>

<p>1739
01:19:03,438 –&gt; 01:19:06,307
YOU A COUPLE OF HOURS.</p>

<p>1740
01:19:04,506 –&gt; 01:19:08,042
I MEAN, IT’S NOT A SMALL</p>

<p>1741
01:19:06,374 –&gt; 01:19:09,477
INVESTMENT OF TIME, BUT IT’S GOT</p>

<p>1742
01:19:08,109 –&gt; 01:19:11,245
A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT ALL</p>

<p>1743
01:19:09,544 –&gt; 01:19:13,881
OF OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND</p>

<p>1744
01:19:11,312 –&gt; 01:19:16,417
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE</p>

<p>1745
01:19:13,948 –&gt; 01:19:20,922
BUSINESS STUDENTS OF A SORT, I</p>

01:19:16,484 –&gt; 01:19:23,458
RECOMMEND YOU GO TO IT.</p>

<p>1747
01:19:20,989 –&gt; 01:19:25,593
THE SUMMARY FIGURES YOU SEE</p>

<p>1748
01:19:23,525 –&gt; 01:19:29,664
HERE, WHICH ARE THE ONES WE PUT</p>

<p>1749
01:19:25,660 –&gt; 01:19:31,900
IN OUR PRESS RELEASE, SHOW KIND</p>

<p>1750
01:19:29,730 –&gt; 01:19:32,133
OF AN INTERESTING PAIR OF</p>

<p>1751
01:19:31,967 –&gt; 01:19:36,337
NUMBERS.</p>

<p>1752
01:19:32,200 –&gt; 01:19:38,906
DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM.</p>

<p>1753
01:19:36,404 –&gt; 01:19:40,474
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE – LAST</p>

<p>1754
01:19:38,973 –&gt; 01:19:41,642
YEAR – WHEN YOU SEE THOSE</p>

<p>1755
01:19:40,541 –&gt; 01:19:43,344
BRACKETS AROUND NUMBERS, YOU’VE</p>

<p>1756
01:19:41,709 –&gt; 01:19:47,815
GOT TO START WORRYING.</p>

<p>1757
01:19:43,411 –&gt; 01:19:50,752
AND FIRST QUARTER WE ACTUALLY</p>

<p>1758
01:19:47,882 –&gt; 01:19:50,985
SHOWED A LOSS OF ALMOST $50</p>

<p>1759
01:19:50,819 –&gt; 01:19:52,286
BILLION.</p>

<p>1760
01:19:51,052 –&gt; 01:19:55,723
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE A</p>

<p>1761
01:19:52,353 –&gt; 01:19:58,159
FIGURE LIKE THAT.</p>

<p>1762
01:19:55,790 –&gt; 01:20:00,228
THINKING BACK, I WAS TRYING TO</p>

<p>1763
01:19:58,226 –&gt; 01:20:01,629
REMEMBER WHETHER I HAD GONE ON</p>

<p>1764
01:20:00,295 –&gt; 01:20:03,464
VACATION DURING THAT QUARTER AND</p>

<p>1765
01:20:01,696 –&gt; 01:20:05,400
TURNED THINGS OVER TO THE OTHER</p>

<p>1766
01:20:03,531 –&gt; 01:20:07,602
GUYS OR WHAT?</p>

<p>1767
01:20:05,467 –&gt; 01:20:08,236
BUT I CHECKED THE CALENDAR AND</p>

<p>1768
01:20:07,669 –&gt; 01:20:10,505
THAT WAS ME.</p>

<p>1769
01:20:08,303 –&gt; 01:20:15,977
THAT FIGURE THIS YEAR IS A</p>

<p>1770
01:20:10,572 –&gt; 01:20:18,346
POSITIVE FIGURE UP 11.7 BILLION,</p>

<p>1771
01:20:16,044 –&gt; 01:20:20,515
AND NEITHER FIGURE IS VERY</p>

<p>1772
01:20:18,413 –&gt; 01:20:22,817
MEANINGFUL IN ITSELF.</p>

<p>1773
01:20:20,582 –&gt; 01:20:25,720
THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD A</p>

<p>1774
01:20:22,884 –&gt; 01:20:28,289
FEW YEARS AGO FOR MANY, MANY,</p>

<p>1775
01:20:25,787 –&gt; 01:20:33,194
MANY, MANY YEARS UNREALIZED</p>

<p>1776
01:20:28,356 –&gt; 01:20:35,863
GAINS OR LOSSES OF A COMPANY</p>

<p>1777
01:20:33,261 –&gt; 01:20:37,432
LIKE BERKSHIRE WHERE THEY MADE</p>

<p>1778
01:20:35,930 –&gt; 01:20:39,066
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE KNELT WORTH</p>

<p>1779
01:20:37,499 –&gt; 01:20:40,001
OF BERKSHIRE BUT THEY DID NOT</p>

<p>1780
01:20:39,133 –&gt; 01:20:43,338
RUN THROUGH EARNINGS.</p>

<p>1781
01:20:40,068 –&gt; 01:20:46,674
AND A FEW YEARS AGO THE RULE WAS</p>

<p>1782
01:20:43,405 –&gt; 01:20:50,444
CHANGED SO THAT EVERY TIME</p>

<p>1783
01:20:46,741 –&gt; 01:20:52,247
STOCKS GO UP OR DOWN, IT GOES</p>

<p>1784
01:20:50,511 –&gt; 01:20:54,048
THROUGH OUR EARNINGS ACCOUNT.</p>

<p>1785
01:20:52,314 –&gt; 01:20:57,085
SO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST</p>

<p>1786
01:20:54,115 –&gt; 01:21:02,890
YEAR WHEN STOCKS WENT DOWN A</p>

<p>1787
01:20:57,152 –&gt; 01:21:04,425
LOT, WE HAD A HUGE SUM OF</p>

<p>1788
01:21:02,957 –&gt; 01:21:07,261
UNREALIZED – WELL, IT WAS A</p>

<p>1789
01:21:04,492 –&gt; 01:21:08,763
REDUCTION OF UNREALIZED GAINS</p>

<p>1790
01:21:07,328 –&gt; 01:21:10,398
AND WHEN YOU START SAYING THINGS</p>

<p>1791
01:21:08,830 –&gt; 01:21:14,869
LIKE THAT YOU START LOSING</p>

<p>1792
01:21:10,465 –&gt; 01:21:16,070
PEOPLE BUT THAT ITEM, MILD PLUS</p>

<p>1793
01:21:14,936 –&gt; 01:21:17,939
THIS YEAR.</p>

<p>1794
01:21:16,137 –&gt; 01:21:20,341
IF WE REPORTED EARNINGS DAILY</p>

<p>1795
01:21:18,006 –&gt; 01:21:23,011
YOU WOULD SEE EARNINGS ONE DAY</p>

<p>1796
01:21:20,408 –&gt; 01:21:23,878
OF 3 BILLION, NEXT DAY MINUS 2</p>

<p>1797
01:21:23,078 –&gt; 01:21:24,779
BILLION.</p>

<p>1798
01:21:23,945 –&gt; 01:21:26,280
IT’S AN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT</p>

<p>1799
01:21:24,846 –&gt; 01:21:28,316
THAT WE DON’T THINK IS</p>

<p>1800
01:21:26,347 –&gt; 01:21:33,821
PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE BUT</p>

<p>1801
01:21:28,383 –&gt; 01:21:36,724
IT’S REQUIRED AND WE’VE</p>

<p>1802
01:21:33,888 –&gt; 01:21:39,427
EXPLAINED VERY CAREFULLY AND I</p>

<p>1803
01:21:36,791 –&gt; 01:21:40,929
TRY TO WRITE IN MY LETTER AND</p>

<p>1804
01:21:39,494 –&gt; 01:21:42,430
EXPLAIN I DON’T THINK THAT’S THE</p>

<p>1805
01:21:40,996 –&gt; 01:21:45,099
WAY TO LOOK AT BERKSHIRE.</p>

<p>1806
01:21:42,497 –&gt; 01:21:46,267
WE THINK OVER TIME WE WILL HAVE</p>

<p>1807
01:21:45,166 –&gt; 01:21:48,636
INVESTMENT GAINS FOR REASONS I</p>

<p>1808
01:21:46,334 –&gt; 01:21:50,538
LAY OUT IN MY LETTER.</p>

<p>1809
01:21:48,703 –&gt; 01:21:53,307
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THE</p>

<p>1810
01:21:50,605 –&gt; 01:21:55,042
COMPANIES WE OWN STOCK IN,</p>

<p>1811
01:21:53,374 –&gt; 01:21:57,345
RETAIN EARNINGS, AND THEY USE</p>

<p>1812
01:21:55,109 –&gt; 01:21:58,846
THOSE REINVESTED EARNINGS</p>

<p>1813
01:21:57,412 –&gt; 01:22:00,648
USUALLY TO OUR BENEFIT AND THAT</p>

<p>1814
01:21:58,913 –&gt; 01:22:00,982
SHOWS UP IN CAPITAL GAINS SOME</p>

<p>1815
01:22:00,715 –&gt; 01:22:02,650
DAY.</p>

<p>1816
01:22:01,049 –&gt; 01:22:08,156
BUT REPORTED EARNINGS FOR A</p>

<p>1817
01:22:02,717 –&gt; 01:22:10,892
COMPANY THAT HAS A LOT OF COMMON</p>

<p>1818
01:22:08,223 –&gt; 01:22:12,927
STOCKS, MARGINABLE STOCKS LIKE</p>

<p>1819
01:22:10,959 –&gt; 01:22:13,695
OURS, YOU DON’T WANT TO LOOK AT</p>

<p>1820
01:22:12,994 –&gt; 01:22:17,398
THE FINAL LINE.</p>

<p>1821
01:22:13,762 –&gt; 01:22:18,166
YOU DO WANT TO LOOK AT THE</p>

<p>1822
01:22:17,465 –&gt; 01:22:22,003
OPERATING EARNINGS LINE.</p>

<p>1823
01:22:18,233 –&gt; 01:22:25,507
NOW I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAD</p>

<p>1824
01:22:22,070 –&gt; 01:22:27,074
TAKEN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF</p>

<p>1825
01:22:25,573 –&gt; 01:22:28,509
LAST YEAR AND COMPARED TO THE</p>

<p>1826
01:22:27,141 –&gt; 01:22:29,777
FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THIS YEAR,</p>

<p>1827
01:22:28,576 –&gt; 01:22:31,445
THOSE FIGURES WOULD HAVE BEEN</p>

<p>1828
01:22:29,844 –&gt; 01:22:35,683
QUITE COMPARABLE, BUT OF COURSE</p>

<p>1829
01:22:31,512 –&gt; 01:22:37,218
IN MARCH OF 2020 THE ECONOMY WAS</p>

<p>1830
01:22:35,750 –&gt; 01:22:41,389
SHUT DOWN IN EFFECT.</p>

<p>1831
01:22:37,285 –&gt; 01:22:43,624
I MEAN, IT WAS A SELF-INDUCED</p>

<p>1832
01:22:41,456 –&gt; 01:22:49,063
RECESSION, AND AN ABRUPT ONE,</p>

<p>1833
01:22:43,691 –&gt; 01:22:53,668
VERY ABRUPT.</p>

<p>1834
01:22:49,130 –&gt; 01:22:57,405
SO THE ECONOMY WENT OFF A CLIFF.</p>

<p>1835
01:22:53,735 –&gt; 01:23:00,575
IN MARCH IT WAS RESURRECTED IN</p>

<p>1836
01:22:57,472 –&gt; 01:23:06,080
AN EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE WAY</p>

<p>1837
01:23:00,642 –&gt; 01:23:08,216
BY FEDERAL RESERVE ACTION AND</p>

<p>1838
01:23:06,147 –&gt; 01:23:09,483
LATER ON THE FISCAL FRONT BY</p>

<p>1839
01:23:08,283 –&gt; 01:23:20,361
CONGRESS, AND WE’LL GET INTO</p>

<p>1840
01:23:09,550 –&gt; 01:23:24,532
THAT LATER, BUT THE FIGURE YOU</p>

<p>1841
01:23:20,428 –&gt; 01:23:29,404
S</p>

<p>1842
01:23:24,599 –&gt; 01:23:29,671
SEE, THE DIFFERENCE WAS MARCH</p>

<p>1843
01:23:29,471 –&gt; 01:23:31,773
BASICALLY.</p>

<p>1844
01:23:29,738 –&gt; 01:23:33,441
WHAT OUR BUSINESSES HAVE DONE</p>

<p>1845
01:23:31,840 –&gt; 01:23:34,075
WE’LL GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS</p>

<p>1846
01:23:33,508 –&gt; 01:23:35,143
LATER.</p>

<p>1847
01:23:34,142 –&gt; 01:23:35,376
OUR BUSINESSES HAVE DONE QUITE</p>

<p>1848
01:23:35,210 –&gt; 01:23:37,445
WELL.</p>

<p>1849
01:23:35,443 –&gt; 01:23:40,348
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY, VERY</p>

<p>1850
01:23:37,512 –&gt; 01:23:44,985
UNUSUAL RECESSION IN THAT IT’S</p>

<p>1851
01:23:40,415 –&gt; 01:23:48,289
BEEN LOCALIZED AS THE INDUSTRY</p>

<p>1852
01:23:45,052 –&gt; 01:23:51,625
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT.</p>

<p>1853
01:23:48,356 –&gt; 01:23:53,461
RIGHT NOW BUSINESS IS REALLY</p>

<p>1854
01:23:51,692 –&gt; 01:23:55,263
VERY GOOD.</p>

<p>1855
01:23:53,528 –&gt; 01:23:57,398
GREAT IN MANY SEGMENTS OF THE</p>

<p>1856
01:23:55,329 –&gt; 01:23:58,900
ECONOMY WHICH WE’LL TALK ABOUT</p>

<p>1857
01:23:57,465 –&gt; 01:24:00,901
LATER, BUT THERE’S STILL</p>

<p>1858
01:23:58,967 –&gt; 01:24:03,438
PROBLEMS IF YOU’RE IN A FEW</p>

<p>1859
01:24:00,968 –&gt; 01:24:05,940
TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE</p>

<p>1860
01:24:03,505 –&gt; 01:24:07,108
BEEN DECIMATED SUCH AS</p>

<p>1861
01:24:06,007 –&gt; 01:24:07,308
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AND THE</p>

<p>1862
01:24:07,175 –&gt; 01:24:09,077
SORT.</p>

<p>1863
01:24:07,375 –&gt; 01:24:11,012
SO WITH THAT, WE’LL GO BACK TO</p>

<p>1864
01:24:09,143 –&gt; 01:24:13,014
THE FIGURES LATER ON.</p>

<p>1865
01:24:11,079 –&gt; 01:24:13,581
PERHAPS IN SOME OF THE</p>

<p>1866
01:24:13,081 –&gt; 01:24:16,517
QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>1867
01:24:13,648 –&gt; 01:24:18,452
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GO OVER TWO</p>

<p>1868
01:24:16,584 –&gt; 01:24:22,890
ITEMS THAT WOULD LIKE</p>

<p>1869
01:24:18,519 –&gt; 01:24:25,993
PARTICULARLY NEW ENTRANTS TO THE</p>

<p>1870
01:24:22,957 –&gt; 01:24:29,230
STOCK MARKET TO PONDER JUST A</p>

<p>1871
01:24:26,060 –&gt; 01:24:33,267
BIT BEFORE THEY TRY AND DO 30 OR</p>

<p>1872
01:24:29,297 –&gt; 01:24:35,736
40 TRADES A DAY IN ORDER TO</p>

<p>1873
01:24:33,334 –&gt; 01:24:40,608
PROFIT FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE A</p>

<p>1874
01:24:35,803 –&gt; 01:24:45,980
VERY EASY GAME.</p>

<p>1875
01:24:40,675 –&gt; 01:24:52,587
I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SLIDE L1.</p>

<p>1876
01:24:46,046 –&gt; 01:24:57,758
PUT THAT UP.</p>

<p>1877
01:24:52,654 –&gt; 01:24:59,793
AND THESE – ON MARCH 31st I RAN</p>

<p>1878
01:24:57,825 –&gt; 01:25:05,699
OFF A LIST OF THE 20 LARGEST</p>

<p>1879
01:24:59,860 –&gt; 01:25:07,568
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY STOCK</p>

<p>1880
01:25:05,766 –&gt; 01:25:09,303
MARKET VALUE, AND THOSE NAMES, A</p>

<p>1881
01:25:07,635 –&gt; 01:25:10,771
GOOD MANY OF WHICH WILL BE</p>

<p>1882
01:25:09,370 –&gt; 01:25:13,541
FAMILIAR TO YOU, BUT THEY WERE</p>

<p>1883
01:25:10,838 –&gt; 01:25:16,377
LED BY APPLE THAT’S SLIGHTLY</p>

<p>1884
01:25:13,608 –&gt; 01:25:18,412
OVER 2 TRILLION.</p>

<p>1885
01:25:16,444 –&gt; 01:25:21,149
AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE NUMBER</p>

<p>1886
01:25:18,479 –&gt; 01:25:25,519
20th WAS WORTH 330 ODD BILLION.</p>

<p>1887
01:25:21,216 –&gt; 01:25:27,121
THOSE ARE THE 20 LARGEST</p>

<p>1888
01:25:25,586 –&gt; 01:25:29,157
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BY MARKET</p>

<p>1889
01:25:27,188 –&gt; 01:25:30,858
VALUE ON MARCH 31st.</p>

<p>1890
01:25:29,224 –&gt; 01:25:33,327
NOW IF I HAD A LITTLE – I WAS</p>

<p>1891
01:25:30,925 –&gt; 01:25:35,229
HOPING I COULD GET A LITTLE QUIZ</p>

<p>1892
01:25:33,394 –&gt; 01:25:39,500
MACHINE SO I COULD HAVE EVERYONE</p>

<p>1893
01:25:35,296 –&gt; 01:25:42,069
WEIGH IN ON THIS ANSWER AND WE</p>

<p>1894
01:25:39,567 –&gt; 01:25:43,671
COULD FLASH IT UP LATER.</p>

<p>1895
01:25:42,136 –&gt; 01:25:45,373
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS</p>

<p>1896
01:25:43,738 –&gt; 01:25:49,477
LOOK AT THAT LIST.</p>

<p>1897
01:25:45,440 –&gt; 01:25:52,513
STARTS OFF WITH APPLE, SAUDI</p>

<p>1898
01:25:49,544 –&gt; 01:25:53,514
ARAMCO’S A SPECIALIZED</p>

<p>1899
01:25:52,580 –&gt; 01:25:55,783
COUNTRY – COMPANY.</p>

<p>1900
01:25:53,581 –&gt; 01:25:58,052
I DON’T KNOW WHETHER IT’S 95%</p>

<p>1901
01:25:55,850 –&gt; 01:26:01,689
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR WHAT,</p>

<p>1902
01:25:58,119 –&gt; 01:26:05,293
BUT IT’S ESSENTIALLY A COUNTRY</p>

<p>1903
01:26:01,756 –&gt; 01:26:05,893
FOR SALE IN TERMS OF THAT</p>

<p>1904
01:26:05,360 –&gt; 01:26:09,030
BUSINESS.</p>

<p>1905
01:26:05,960 –&gt; 01:26:10,464
THE TOP – OF THE TOP SIX</p>

<p>1906
01:26:09,097 –&gt; 01:26:10,898
COMPANIES, FIVE OF THEM ARE</p>

<p>1907
01:26:10,531 –&gt; 01:26:14,268
AMERICAN.</p>

<p>1908
01:26:10,965 –&gt; 01:26:17,838
I CAN HEAR PEOPLE SAY AMERICA</p>

<p>1909
01:26:14,335 –&gt; 01:26:22,143
HAS – IT’S NOT WORKING VERY</p>

<p>1910
01:26:17,905 –&gt; 01:26:24,111
WELL OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT.</p>

<p>1911
01:26:22,210 –&gt; 01:26:25,846
SIX TOP COMPANIES IN VALUE, FIVE</p>

<p>1912
01:26:24,178 –&gt; 01:26:27,214
OF THEM ARE IN THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p>1913
01:26:25,913 –&gt; 01:26:29,617
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE</p>

<p>1914
01:26:27,281 –&gt; 01:26:29,817
TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THIS LAST</p>

<p>1915
01:26:29,684 –&gt; 01:26:34,288
YEAR.</p>

<p>1916
01:26:29,884 –&gt; 01:26:36,857
IN 1790 WE HAD 1/2 OF 1% OF THE</p>

<p>1917
01:26:34,355 –&gt; 01:26:40,294
WORLD’S POPULATION.</p>

<p>1918
01:26:36,924 –&gt; 01:26:42,163
A LITTLE LESS.</p>

<p>1919
01:26:40,361 –&gt; 01:26:43,531
OOF,000 PEOPLE WERE SLAVES.</p>

<p>1920
01:26:42,230 –&gt; 01:26:46,601
IRELAND HAD MORE PEOPLE THAN THE</p>

<p>1921
01:26:43,598 –&gt; 01:26:50,805
UNITED STATES HAD.</p>

<p>1922
01:26:46,668 –&gt; 01:26:53,641
RUSSIA HAD AS MANY TIMES AS –</p>

<p>1924
01:26:53,708 –&gt; 01:26:57,845
PEOPLE.</p>

<p>1925
01:26:53,941 –&gt; 01:27:02,216
WHAT DID WE HAVE?</p>

<p>1926
01:26:57,912 –&gt; 01:27:04,051
WE HAD A MAP OF THE FUTURE,</p>

<p>1927
01:27:02,283 –&gt; 01:27:08,189
ASPIRATIONAL MAP THAT SOMEHOW</p>

<p>1928
01:27:04,118 –&gt; 01:27:13,260
NOW ONLY 200 – WELL, AFTER THE</p>

<p>1929
01:27:08,256 –&gt; 01:27:16,463
CONSTITUTION, 232 YEARS LATER</p>

<p>1930
01:27:13,327 –&gt; 01:27:20,301
LEAVES SUS WITH FIVE OF THE TOP</p>

<p>1931
01:27:16,530 –&gt; 01:27:21,969
SIX COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p>1932
01:27:20,368 –&gt; 01:27:24,739
THAT’S NOT AN ACCIDENT AND IT’S</p>

<p>1933
01:27:22,036 –&gt; 01:27:26,774
NOT BECAUSE WE WERE WAY SMARTER,</p>

<p>1934
01:27:24,806 –&gt; 01:27:28,075
WAY STRONGER OR ANYTHING OF THE</p>

<p>1935
01:27:26,841 –&gt; 01:27:32,747
SORT.</p>

<p>1936
01:27:28,142 –&gt; 01:27:34,782
WE HAD GOOD SOIL, DECENT</p>

<p>1937
01:27:32,814 –&gt; 01:27:37,351
CLIMATE, BUT SO DID SOME OF THE</p>

<p>1938
01:27:34,848 –&gt; 01:27:43,024
OTHER COUNTRIES I NAMED.</p>

<p>1939
01:27:37,418 –&gt; 01:27:45,059
THIS SYSTEM HAS WORKED VERY</p>

<p>1940
01:27:43,091 –&gt; 01:27:48,696
WELL.</p>

<p>1941
01:27:45,126 –&gt; 01:27:54,935
IMAGINE THINKING OF A COUNTRY</p>

<p>1942
01:27:48,763 –&gt; 01:27:56,303
WITH 1/2 OF THE LIST.</p>

<p>1943
01:27:55,002 –&gt; 01:27:58,706
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS</p>

<p>1944
01:27:56,370 –&gt; 01:28:02,209
LOOK AT THAT LIST FOR A MINUTE</p>

<p>1945
01:27:58,773 –&gt; 01:28:08,816
OR TWO IF YOU WANT TO AND THEN</p>

<p>1946
01:28:02,276 –&gt; 01:28:09,183
MAKE AN ESTIMATE, YOUR YOEN OWN</p>

<p>1947
01:28:08,882 –&gt; 01:28:14,254
GUEST.</p>

<p>1948
01:28:09,250 –&gt; 01:28:14,555
HERE THEY ARE, THESE POWE</p>

<p>1949
01:28:14,321 –&gt; 01:28:16,190
POWERHOUSES.</p>

<p>1950
01:28:14,622 –&gt; 01:28:20,795
IT’S NOT GOING TO BE ALL 20.</p>

<p>1951
01:28:16,257 –&gt; 01:28:22,163
IT MAY NOT BE ALL 20 TODAY OR</p>

<p>1952
01:28:20,862 –&gt; 01:28:27,735
TOMORROW.</p>

<p>1953
01:28:22,230 –&gt; 01:28:28,569
THIS WAS MARCH 31st, BUT WHAT</p>

<p>1954
01:28:27,802 –&gt; 01:28:30,771
WOULD YOU GUESS?</p>

<p>1955
01:28:28,636 –&gt; 01:28:32,239
THINK ABOUT THAT YOURSELF.</p>

<p>1956
01:28:30,838 –&gt; 01:28:33,440
WOULD YOU PUT DOWN FIVE, EIGHT?</p>

<p>1957
01:28:32,306 –&gt; 01:28:36,643
WHATEVER IT WOULD BE, I WOULD</p>

<p>1958
01:28:33,507 –&gt; 01:28:41,482
NOW INVITE YOU TO LOOK AT SLIDE</p>

<p>1959
01:28:36,710 –&gt; 01:28:45,786
2 – WELL, 2, WHICH GOES BACK A</p>

<p>1960
01:28:41,549 –&gt; 01:28:51,625
LITTLE MORE THAN 30 YEARS.</p>

<p>1961
01:28:45,853 –&gt; 01:28:54,261
LOOK AT THE TOP 20 FROM 1989 AND</p>

<p>1962
01:28:51,692 –&gt; 01:28:55,696
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP 20 FROM</p>

<p>1963
01:28:54,328 –&gt; 01:28:57,197
1989, THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT</p>

<p>1964
01:28:55,763 –&gt; 01:29:00,101
SHOULD GRAB YOUR INTEREST, AT</p>

<p>1965
01:28:57,264 –&gt; 01:29:02,803
LEAST TWO.</p>

<p>1966
01:29:00,168 –&gt; 01:29:05,706
NONE OF THE 20 FROM 30 YEARS AGO</p>

<p>1967
01:29:02,870 –&gt; 01:29:08,976
ARE ON THE PRESENT LIST, NONE,</p>

<p>1968
01:29:05,773 –&gt; 01:29:11,245
ZERO.</p>

<p>1969
01:29:09,043 –&gt; 01:29:12,680
DUH, THERE WERE SIX U.K.</p>

<p>1970
01:29:11,312 –&gt; 01:29:13,681
COMPANIES ON THE LIST AND THEIR</p>

<p>1971
01:29:12,747 –&gt; 01:29:15,382
NAMES ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU.</p>

<p>1972
01:29:13,748 –&gt; 01:29:21,756
WE HAVE GENERAL ELECTRIC, WE</p>

<p>1973
01:29:15,449 –&gt; 01:29:28,329
HAVE EXXON, IBM CORP.</p>

<p>1974
01:29:21,823 –&gt; 01:29:32,333
MERCK HAS DONE THEIR NUMBER.</p>

<p>1975
01:29:28,396 –&gt; 01:29:35,102
YUN MADE IT.</p>

<p>1976
01:29:32,399 –&gt; 01:29:38,906
I ASKED YOU TO PLAY THE QUIZ.</p>

<p>1977
01:29:35,169 –&gt; 01:29:42,643
I DON’T THINK IT WILL BE ZERO</p>

<p>1978
01:29:38,973 –&gt; 01:29:43,410
BUT IT IS A REMINDER OF WHAT</p>

<p>1979
01:29:42,710 –&gt; 01:29:47,748
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ARE GOING</p>

<p>1980
01:29:43,477 –&gt; 01:29:49,617
TO HAPPEN, THINGS THAT SEEM</p>

<p>1981
01:29:47,815 –&gt; 01:29:51,618
OBVIOUS TO YOU.</p>

<p>1982
01:29:49,684 –&gt; 01:29:52,720
JAPAN HAD THIS WONDERFUL BULL</p>

<p>1983
01:29:51,685 –&gt; 01:29:59,626
MARKET FOR A LONG TIME.</p>

<p>1984
01:29:52,787 –&gt; 01:30:02,496
YOU HAD A NUMBER OF JAPANESE</p>

<p>1985
01:29:59,693 –&gt; 01:30:07,134
COUPLES ON THE CASE.</p>

<p>1986
01:30:02,563 –&gt; 01:30:08,936
UNITED STATES HAS THE 6, AND I</p>

<p>1987
01:30:07,200 –&gt; 01:30:13,641
WOULD INVITE YOU TO LOOK AT ONE</p>

<p>1988
01:30:09,003 –&gt; 01:30:14,141
OTHER THING AS YOU LOOK AT THIS</p>

<p>1989
01:30:13,708 –&gt; 01:30:14,575
ADD</p>

<p>1990
01:30:14,208 –&gt; 01:30:20,981
ADDRESS.</p>

<p>1991
01:30:14,642 –&gt; 01:30:22,550
WE WEREN’T JUST KISS COVERING</p>

<p>1992
01:30:21,048 –&gt; 01:30:23,684
CAPITALISM.</p>

<p>1993
01:30:22,617 –&gt; 01:30:26,487
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE IN.</p>

<p>1994
01:30:23,751 –&gt; 01:30:28,222
IT WAS NOT A BACKWARD TIME AND</p>

<p>1995
01:30:26,554 –&gt; 01:30:30,624
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE TOP COMPANY</p>

<p>1996
01:30:28,288 –&gt; 01:30:33,260
AT THAT TIME HAD A MARKET VALUE</p>

<p>1997
01:30:30,691 –&gt; 01:30:37,064
OF 104 BILLION.</p>

<p>1998
01:30:33,327 –&gt; 01:30:40,300
SO THE LARGEST COMPANY IN THE</p>

<p>1999
01:30:37,131 –&gt; 01:30:43,937
WORLD OF TITLE IN JUST A SHADE</p>

<p>2000
01:30:40,367 –&gt; 01:30:45,172
OVER 30 YEARS HAS GONE FROM 100</p>

<p>2001
01:30:44,004 –&gt; 01:30:49,443
BILLION TO 2 TRILLION.</p>

<p>2002
01:30:45,239 –&gt; 01:30:56,817
AT THE BOTTOM THE NUMBER 20 HAS</p>

<p>2003
01:30:49,510 –&gt; 01:30:59,153
GONE FROM 34, A LITTLE OVER TEN</p>

<p>2004
01:30:56,884 –&gt; 01:31:03,958
TIMES THAT.</p>

<p>2005
01:30:59,220 –&gt; 01:31:06,694
THIS TELLS YOU WHAT’S HAPPENED.</p>

<p>2006
01:31:04,025 –&gt; 01:31:08,028
IT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT</p>

<p>2007
01:31:06,761 –&gt; 01:31:10,064
INFLATION, BUT THIS WAS NOT A</p>

<p>2008
01:31:08,095 –&gt; 01:31:10,331
HIGHLY INFLATIONARY PERIOD AS A</p>

<p>2009
01:31:10,131 –&gt; 01:31:16,036
WHOLE.</p>

<p>2010
01:31:10,398 –&gt; 01:31:19,139
BUT IT TELLS YOU THAT CAPITALISM</p>

<p>2011
01:31:16,103 –&gt; 01:31:22,877
HAS WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL,</p>

<p>2012
01:31:19,206 –&gt; 01:31:23,644
ESPECIALLY IF YOU’RE THE</p>

<p>2013
01:31:22,944 –&gt; 01:31:28,516
CAPITALIST.</p>

<p>2014
01:31:23,711 –&gt; 01:31:28,749
IT’S A PRETTY A STAUNDING</p>

<p>2015
01:31:28,583 –&gt; 01:31:32,352
NUMBER.</p>

<p>2016
01:31:28,816 –&gt; 01:31:36,524
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE 2</p>

<p>2017
01:31:32,419 –&gt; 01:31:36,791
TRILLION FOR THE THE R FINE</p>

<p>2018
01:31:36,590 –&gt; 01:31:38,158
COMPANIES.</p>

<p>2019
01:31:36,857 –&gt; 01:31:39,527
THAT’S FOR THE LEADER.</p>

<p>2020
01:31:38,225 –&gt; 01:31:42,229
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.</p>

<p>2021
01:31:39,594 –&gt; 01:31:43,130
MAYBE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.</p>

<p>2022
01:31:42,296 –&gt; 01:31:45,899
WE WERE JUST AS SURE OF</p>

<p>2023
01:31:43,197 –&gt; 01:31:48,869
OURSELVES AS INVESTORS OUT OF</p>

<p>2024
01:31:45,966 –&gt; 01:31:59,246
WALL STREET WAS IN 1989 AS WE</p>

<p>2025
01:31:48,936 –&gt; 01:32:00,047
ARE TODAY, BUT THE WORLD DIDN’T</p>

<p>2026
01:31:59,313 –&gt; 01:32:03,350
CHANGE.</p>

<p>2027
01:32:00,114 –&gt; 01:32:06,353
I’LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE OTHER</p>

<p>2028
01:32:03,417 –&gt; 01:32:13,727
EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT PONDER.</p>

<p>2029
01:32:06,420 –&gt; 01:32:17,498
ONE THING IT SHOWS IS THAT IT’S</p>

<p>2030
01:32:13,794 –&gt; 01:32:18,565
A GREAT ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>2031
01:32:17,564 –&gt; 01:32:19,900
THE AMAZING THING WAS TO BE</p>

<p>2032
01:32:18,632 –&gt; 01:32:21,735
ABOARD A SHIP.</p>

<p>2033
01:32:19,967 –&gt; 01:32:23,503
THEY WERE GOING TO A BETTER</p>

<p>2034

PROMISED LAND, THEY DIDN’T KNOW</p>

<p>2035
01:32:23,570 –&gt; 01:32:31,011
WHICH ONE THEY NIECELY GOT ON.</p>

<p>2036

DO A HOLDOVER, YEAR-TO-YEAR</p>

THE PLACE TO BE.</p>

THE PLACE TO BE IN 1903 WHEN MY</p>

<p>2054
01:33:43,517 –&gt; 01:33:52,826
THAT’S BIG NEWS.</p>

<p>2055
01:33:46,220 –&gt; 01:33:54,495
THIS HAS HAD A COUPLE OF TIMES</p>

<p>2056
01:33:52,893 –&gt; 01:33:57,031

01:34:00,201 –&gt; 01:34:07,775
BUT IT TRANSFORMED THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>2061
01:34:03,738 –&gt; 01:34:08,676
AND HENRY FORD BROUGHT IN THE $5</p>

<p>2063
01:34:08,743 –&gt; 01:34:14,748
THAT WAS A HUGE THING.</p>

<p>2064
01:34:10,511 –&gt; 01:34:16,016
SIMPLY LINES OUT THE WHOLE</p>

IT’S GOING TO BE CARS.</p>

<p>2074
01:34:35,336 –&gt; 01:34:43,777
IT’S GOING TO BE AUTOS.</p>

<p>2075

<p>2083
01:34:57,825 –&gt; 01:35:05,065
WE OWN A COMPANY CALLED MARMON.</p>

<p>2084
01:35:01,195 –&gt; 01:35:06,700
WE BOUGHT IT SOME YEARS AGO.</p>

<p>2085
01:35:05,132 –&gt; 01:35:08,602
PRITZKERS HAD BUILT THIS</p>

<p>2086
01:35:06,767 –&gt; 01:35:10,470
BUSINESS FROM MANY, MANY, MANY</p>

<p>2087
01:35:08,669 –&gt; 01:35:12,873
COMPANIES THAT THEY HAD ACQUIRED</p>

<p>2088
01:35:10,537 –&gt; 01:35:14,842
AND THE NAME OF THEIR COMPANY</p>

<p>2089
01:35:12,940 –&gt; 01:35:19,146
WAS CALLED MARMOM.</p>

<p>2090
01:35:14,909 –&gt; 01:35:21,882
I DON’T KNOW EXACTLY WHY THEY</p>

<p>2091
01:35:19,213 –&gt; 01:35:31,091
DECIDED TO NAME IT MARMAN, BUT</p>

<p>2092
01:35:21,948 –&gt; 01:35:31,391
THEY DID OWN A COMPANY CALLED</p>

<p>2093
01:35:31,158 –&gt; 01:35:35,962
HARMON.</p>

<p>2094

<p>2096
01:35:37,531 –&gt; 01:35:43,670

<p>2097
01:35:41,335 –&gt; 01:35:47,107
WE CALLED IT – IT WAS – THEY</p>

<p>2098
01:35:43,737 –&gt; 01:35:53,480
OWNED THIS COMPANY, MARMON,</p>

<p>2099
01:35:47,174 –&gt; 01:35:57,851
WHICH IN 1911 HAD BEEN A – THE</p>

<p>2100
01:35:53,547 –&gt; 01:35:58,652
COMPANY WHOSE CAR WON THE FIRST</p>

<p>2101
01:35:57,918 –&gt; 01:36:00,321
INDIANAPOLIS 500.</p>

<p>2102
01:35:58,719 –&gt; 01:36:02,422
MAYBE THAT’S WHY THEY CALLED</p>

<p>2103
01:36:00,387 –&gt; 01:36:05,458
THEM MARMON.</p>

<p>2104
01:36:02,489 –&gt; 01:36:14,168
THEY FOUNDED THE COMPANY THEN</p>

<p>2105
01:36:05,525 –&gt; 01:36:14,368

SATURDAY NEXT TO HIM AND LOOKED</p>

BACKWARDS, THEY INVENTED THE</p>

<p>2113

REAR-VIEW MIRROR.</p>

<p>2114

LET’S JUST ASSUME THAT THEY</p>

<p>2115
01:36:37,457 –&gt; 01:36:41,661
DECIDED THAT AUTOS WERE THIS</p>

<p>2116
01:36:39,526 –&gt; 01:36:43,397
INCREDIBLE THING AND SOME DAY</p>

<p>2117
01:36:41,728 –&gt; 01:36:46,266
THERE WOULD BE AN INDIANAPOLIS</p>

<p>2118
01:36:43,464 –&gt; 01:36:51,438
500, THEY WOULD HAVE REAR VIEW</p>

<p>2119
01:36:46,333 –&gt; 01:36:54,441
MIRRORS AND 290 MILLION CARS</p>

<p>2120
01:36:51,505 –&gt; 01:36:58,445
WOULD BE BUZZING.</p>

<p>2121
01:36:54,508 –&gt; 01:37:03,650
AND SO I DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE</p>

<p>2122
01:36:58,512 –&gt; 01:37:08,688
HISTORY AND I THOUGHT I PUT UP A</p>

<p>2123
01:37:03,717 –&gt; 01:37:10,090
LIST FROM THE – AND I WAS</p>

<p>2124
01:37:08,755 –&gt; 01:37:12,259
ORIGINALLY GOING TO PUT UP THE</p>

<p>2125
01:37:10,157 –&gt; 01:37:15,062
Ms SO I COULD GET THEM ON ONE</p>

<p>2126
01:37:12,326 –&gt; 01:37:18,699
SLIDE BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE Ms,</p>

<p>2127
01:37:15,129 –&gt; 01:37:20,433
I WENT ON AND ON AND ON.</p>

<p>2128
01:37:18,766 –&gt; 01:37:21,435
I DECIDED TO PUT UP ONES THAT</p>

<p>2129
01:37:20,500 –&gt; 01:37:25,705
STARTED WITH MA.</p>

<p>2130
01:37:21,502 –&gt; 01:37:29,943
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE WERE</p>

<p>2131
01:37:25,772 –&gt; 01:37:36,350
ALMOST 40 COMPANIES THAT WENT</p>

<p>2132
01:37:30,010 –&gt; 01:37:36,750
INTO THE AUTO BUSINESS.</p>

<p>2133

MARCHMAN PRODUCT.</p>

<p>2135
01:37:39,253 –&gt; 01:37:49,462
1930s WERE REALLY QUITE SPECIAL.</p>

<p>2136
01:37:46,226 –&gt; 01:37:53,299
THERE WERE AT LEAST 2,000</p>

<p>2137
01:37:49,529 –&gt; 01:37:57,537
COMPANIES THAT ENTERED THE AUTO</p>

<p>2138
01:37:53,366 –&gt; 01:37:58,772
BUSINESS BECAUSE IT CLEARLY HAD</p>

<p>2139

THIS INCREDIBLE FUTURE.</p>

<p>2140
01:37:58,839 –&gt; 01:38:05,045
OF COURSE, YOU REMEMBER THAT IN</p>

<p>2141
01:38:03,177 –&gt; 01:38:06,647
2009 THERE WERE THREE LEFT, TWO</p>

<p>2142

OF WHICH WENT BANKRUPT.</p>

<p>2143
01:38:06,714 –&gt; 01:38:13,987
SO THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO</p>

<p>2144
01:38:10,851 –&gt; 01:38:18,491
PICKING STOCKS THAN TRYING TO</p>

<p>2145

01:38:33,640 –&gt; 01:38:38,645

<p>2159

WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEM.</p>

BUT WE DIDN’T SELL A</p>

JUST GOT TO MENTION THE AIRLINE</p>

BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR AND</p>

<p>2224
01:41:37,257 –&gt; 01:41:42,062
THEN I’LL GET ON WITH WHAT WAS</p>

<p>2225
01:41:40,427 –&gt; 01:41:45,698
DONE IN FISCAL MONETARY POLICY.</p>

<p>2226
01:41:42,129 –&gt; 01:41:48,301
WE HAD A FEW PEOPLE, VARIOUS</p>

<p>2227
01:41:45,765 –&gt; 01:41:51,738
AREAS OF BERKSHIRE, THAT WANTED</p>

<p>2228
01:41:48,368 –&gt; 01:41:54,874
TO GO IN FOR HELP FROM THE</p>

<p>2229
01:41:51,805 –&gt; 01:41:56,843
GOVERNMENT AND IN SOME CASES</p>

<p>2230
01:41:54,941 –&gt; 01:41:58,945
THEY HAD MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS</p>

<p>2231
01:41:56,910 –&gt; 01:42:02,248
OWNING A FEW PERCENT.</p>

<p>2232
01:41:59,012 –&gt; 01:42:04,317
WE’RE GOING TO GET KILLED BY</p>

<p>2233
01:42:02,315 –&gt; 01:42:07,053
WHAT’S HAPPENING WITH THE</p>

<p>2234
01:42:04,384 –&gt; 01:42:08,421
REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING PUT</p>

<p>2235
01:42:07,120 –&gt; 01:42:09,756
OUT STOPPING THE ECONOMY.</p>

<p>2236
01:42:08,488 –&gt; 01:42:13,026
THEY SAID, EVERYBODY’S GOING IN</p>

<p>2237
01:42:09,822 –&gt; 01:42:16,263
FOR THEM, WHY DON’T WE GO IN?</p>

<p>2238
01:42:13,093 –&gt; 01:42:19,499
I SAID, BERKSHIRE CAN HANDLE IT.</p>

<p>2239
01:42:16,330 –&gt; 01:42:22,802
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN’T</p>

<p>2240
01:42:19,566 –&gt; 01:42:24,337
HANDLE IT SO WE’RE NOT APPLYING</p>

<p>2241
01:42:22,869 –&gt; 01:42:27,907
FOR IT.</p>

<p>2242
01:42:24,404 –&gt; 01:42:33,413
THE AIRLINES WERE THE MOST</p>

<p>2243
01:42:27,974 –&gt; 01:42:38,485
PROMINENT BENEFICIARIES OF WHAT</p>

<p>2244

TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AT THIS.</p>

<p>2245
01:42:38,552 –&gt; 01:42:46,560
GRANTS NOT LOANS.</p>

<p>2246
01:42:41,922 –&gt; 01:42:46,793
AND I THINK THAT WAS FINE PUBLIC</p>

<p>2247
01:42:46,627 –&gt; 01:42:50,863
POLICY.</p>

<p>2248
01:42:46,860 –&gt; 01:42:51,931
I WISH IT COULD GO TO EVERY pRE</p>

<p>2249
01:42:50,930 –&gt; 01:42:53,533
BUSINESS THAT WAS OUT OF</p>

<p>2250
01:42:51,998 –&gt; 01:42:55,301
BUSINESS AND HAD NO – THEY</p>

<p>2251
01:42:53,600 –&gt; 01:42:58,838
WERE – THEY WERE – THEY WERE</p>

<p>2252
01:42:55,368 –&gt; 01:43:00,006
MADE TOAST OF BASICALLY, BUT THE</p>

<p>2253
01:42:58,905 –&gt; 01:43:02,375
AIRLINES CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED</p>

<p>2254
01:43:00,073 –&gt; 01:43:03,843
WAS NOT THEIR FAULT IN ANY WAY,</p>

<p>2255
01:43:02,442 –&gt; 01:43:11,684
SHAPE, OR FORM.</p>

<p>2256

<p>2259
01:43:15,155 –&gt; 01:43:18,157
THREE OF THE FOUR VICTIMS WENT</p>

<p>2260
01:43:17,123 –&gt; 01:43:21,227
THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY.</p>

<p>2261
01:43:18,224 –&gt; 01:43:26,499
THE AIRLINES WERE BECOMING USED</p>

<p>2262
01:43:21,294 –&gt; 01:43:28,735
TO OPERATING IN – IT WAS</p>

<p>2263
01:43:26,566 –&gt; 01:43:29,436
PERFECTLY PROPER FOR THE AIRLINE</p>

<p>2264
01:43:28,802 –&gt; 01:43:31,271
INDUSTRY.</p>

<p>2265
01:43:29,503 –&gt; 01:43:32,305
YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES OF 2</p>

<p>2266
01:43:31,338 –&gt; 01:43:34,140
TRILLION FOR APPLE.</p>

<p>2267
01:43:32,372 –&gt; 01:43:37,277
THE ENTIRE BIG FOUR AIRLINES,</p>

<p>2268
01:43:34,207 –&gt; 01:43:38,645
THEY WERE – THEY SOLD FOR ABOUT</p>

<p>2269
01:43:37,344 –&gt; 01:43:40,080
$100 BILLION ALMOST.</p>

<p>2270
01:43:38,712 –&gt; 01:43:40,913
VERY, VERY SMALL.</p>

<p>2271
01:43:40,147 –&gt; 01:43:43,416
COMBINED THEY WOULDN’T COME</p>

<p>2272
01:43:40,980 –&gt; 01:43:45,084
CLOSE TO MAKING THE CUT.</p>

<p>2273
01:43:43,483 –&gt; 01:43:45,885
I MEAN, THEY WOULDN’T BE IN THE</p>

<p>2274
01:43:45,151 –&gt; 01:43:47,988
TOP 50.</p>

<p>2275
01:43:45,952 –&gt; 01:43:48,288
SO, ANYWAY, THEY WENT INTO THE</p>

<p>2276
01:43:48,055 –&gt; 01:43:49,622
GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>2277
01:43:48,355 –&gt; 01:43:53,760
THEY NEEDED THE GOVERNMENT HELP</p>

<p>2278
01:43:49,689 –&gt; 01:43:58,231
OR THEY NEEDED – OR THEY WOULD</p>

<p>2279
01:43:53,827 –&gt; 01:44:00,967
GO BANKRUPT, SOME OF THEM.</p>

<p>2280
01:43:58,298 –&gt; 01:44:03,170
AND REALLY CONGRESS AND STEVE</p>

<p>2281
01:44:01,034 –&gt; 01:44:05,238
MNUCHIN TOO, THEY DECIDED THEY</p>

<p>2282
01:44:03,236 –&gt; 01:44:08,642
DESERVED HELP, WHICH I DO NOT</p>

<p>2283
01:44:05,305 –&gt; 01:44:11,745
QUARREL WITH AT ALL, BUT IMAGINE</p>

<p>2284
01:44:08,709 –&gt; 01:44:14,147
IF BERKSHIRE WAS THE 10% HOLDER,</p>

<p>2285
01:44:11,812 –&gt; 01:44:15,815
WHICH THEY HAD BEEN.</p>

<p>2286
01:44:14,214 –&gt; 01:44:19,319
BERKSHIRE, IT WOULD BE LIKE ONE</p>

<p>2287
01:44:15,882 –&gt; 01:44:21,254
OF OUR – THEY MIGHT VERY WELL</p>

<p>2288
01:44:19,386 –&gt; 01:44:22,656
HAVE HAD A VERY, VERY, VERY</p>

<p>2289
01:44:21,321 –&gt; 01:44:26,192
DIFFERENT RESULT IF THEY HAD HAD</p>

<p>2290
01:44:22,723 –&gt; 01:44:29,095
A VERY, VERY, VERY RICH</p>

<p>2291

SHAREHOLDER THAT OWNED 8 OR 9%.</p>

<p>2292
01:44:29,162 –&gt; 01:44:34,634
THEY DIDN’T HAVE THAT.</p>

<p>2293
01:44:33,266 –&gt; 01:44:35,402
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE</p>

<p>2294
01:44:34,701 –&gt; 01:44:37,203
SAME RESULT.</p>

<p>2295
01:44:35,469 –&gt; 01:44:38,838
IN FACT, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN’T.</p>

<p>2296
01:44:37,270 –&gt; 01:44:40,440
I CAN SEE THE HEADLINES BECAUSE</p>

<p>2297
01:44:38,905 –&gt; 01:44:42,242
YOU’VE SEEN THE HEADLINES ON</p>

<p>2298
01:44:40,507 –&gt; 01:44:43,810
SOME COMPANIES THAT TOOK 100</p>

<p>2299
01:44:42,309 –&gt; 01:44:45,178
MILLION, THE AIRLINE DIDN’T NEED</p>

<p>2300
01:44:43,877 –&gt; 01:44:50,684
IT, SOME OF THEM GAVE IT BACK.</p>

<p>2301
01:44:45,245 –&gt; 01:44:52,419
MOST OF THEM GAVE IT BACK.</p>

<p>2302
01:44:50,751 –&gt; 01:44:53,720
BUT YOU’RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A</p>

<p>2303
01:44:52,486 –&gt; 01:44:54,788
DIFFERENT RESULT THAN IF WE HAD</p>

<p>2304
01:44:53,787 –&gt; 01:45:00,660
KEPT OUR STOCK.</p>

<p>2305
01:44:54,855 –&gt; 01:45:03,963
BUT IN ANY EVENT, AN INDUSTRY</p>

<p>2306
01:45:00,727 –&gt; 01:45:05,432
THAT WAS SELLING FOR LESS THAN</p>

<p>2307
01:45:04,030 –&gt; 01:45:07,633
$100 MILLION.</p>

<p>2308
01:45:05,499 –&gt; 01:45:08,501
THEY LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT</p>

<p>2309
01:45:07,700 –&gt; 01:45:12,872
OF MONEY.</p>

<p>2310
01:45:08,568 –&gt; 01:45:16,476
THEY LOST PERSPECTIVE EARNING</p>

<p>2311
01:45:12,939 –&gt; 01:45:20,613
POWER.</p>

<p>2312
01:45:16,543 –&gt; 01:45:29,255
I WOULD SAY THE ECONOMIC</p>

<p>2313
01:45:20,680 –&gt; 01:45:33,927
RECOVERY HAS GONE FAR BETTER AND</p>

<p>2314
01:45:29,322 –&gt; 01:45:36,196
I CUT BACK SOME OF THE BANK</p>

<p>2315
01:45:33,994 –&gt; 01:45:40,900
INVESTMENT.</p>

<p>2316
01:45:36,263 –&gt; 01:45:46,873
BASICALLY OUR NET SALES WERE</p>

<p>2317
01:45:40,967 –&gt; 01:45:48,741
1.5%.</p>

<p>2318
01:45:46,940 –&gt; 01:45:52,044
I CONSIDERED IT A GREAT MOMENT</p>

<p>2319
01:45:48,808 –&gt; 01:45:54,013
IN BERKSHIRE HISTORY BUT WE’VE</p>

<p>2320
01:45:52,111 –&gt; 01:45:55,381
GOT MORE NET WORTH THAN ANY</p>

<p>2321
01:45:54,080 –&gt; 01:45:56,149
OTHER COMPANY IN THE UNITED</p>

<p>2322
01:45:55,448 –&gt; 01:46:00,353
STATES UNDER ACCOUNTING</p>

<p>2323
01:45:56,216 –&gt; 01:46:02,255
PRINCIPLES AND WE’VE GOT 6 OR</p>

<p>2324
01:46:00,420 –&gt; 01:46:03,923
700 BILLION IN BUSINESSES AND AS</p>

<p>2325
01:46:02,322 –&gt; 01:46:05,425
I THINK THE AIRLINE BUSINESSES</p>

<p>2326
01:46:03,990 –&gt; 01:46:06,659
HAVE DONE BETTER BECAUSE WE SOLD</p>

<p>2327
01:46:05,492 –&gt; 01:46:10,196
AND I WISH THEM WELL.</p>

<p>2328
01:46:06,726 –&gt; 01:46:11,698
I STILL WOULDN’T WANT TO BUY THE</p>

01:46:10,263 –&gt; 01:46:15,067
AIRLINE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL.</p>

<p>2330
01:46:11,765 –&gt; 01:46:19,272
PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO – THEY</p>

<p>2331
01:46:15,134 –&gt; 01:46:21,107
WANT TO TRAVEL FOR PERSONAL</p>

<p>2332
01:46:19,339 –&gt; 01:46:22,208
REASONS AND BUSINESS TRAVEL IS</p>

<p>2333
01:46:21,173 –&gt; 01:46:24,010
THE OTHER THING.</p>

<p>2334
01:46:22,275 –&gt; 01:46:25,011
WE’VE GOT A BIG EXPOSURE TO</p>

<p>2335
01:46:24,077 –&gt; 01:46:27,480
BUSINESS TRAVEL, OF COURSE,</p>

<p>2336
01:46:25,077 –&gt; 01:46:31,617
THROUGH THE FACT THAT WE OWN 19%</p>

<p>2337
01:46:27,547 –&gt; 01:46:33,085
OF AMERICAN EXPRESS AND WE OWN</p>

<p>2338
01:46:31,684 –&gt; 01:46:34,387
PRECISION GAS PARTS WHICH</p>

<p>2339

SERVICES THE AIR BUSINESS.</p>

<p>2340
01:46:34,454 –&gt; 01:46:41,227
WE’VE STILL GOT A BIG BUSINESS</p>

<p>2341
01:46:37,323 –&gt; 01:46:42,262
INVESTMENT IN AIR TRAVEL, A BIG</p>

<p>2342
01:46:41,294 –&gt; 01:46:46,433
COMMITMENT TO IT.</p>

<p>2343

<p>2352

YOU SPENT YEARS INSISTING YOU</p>

<p>2353
01:47:06,753 –&gt; 01:47:10,957
HAD YOUR ELEPHANT GUN READY.</p>

<p>2363
01:47:23,669 –&gt; 01:47:31,444

01:47:26,639 –&gt; 01:47:38,318
OF OUR VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES</p>

<p>2365
01:47:31,510 –&gt; 01:47:42,055
AND THAT’S A HEALTHY CHUNK.</p>

<p>2366
01:47:38,385 –&gt; 01:47:46,059
I SAY I’LL NEVER GET BELOW 20</p>

<p>2367

BILLION BUT WE’RE GOING TO RAISE</p>

THE SIZE.</p>

<p>2369
01:47:50,497 –&gt; 01:47:56,436
WE COULD HAVE DEPLOYED 50 OR 75</p>

BILLION AND RIGHT BEFORE THE FED</p>

ACT – I MEAN, AT A POINT WHERE</p>

<p>2372
01:48:00,707 –&gt; 01:48:04,443
THE CALLS WERE – TWO CALLS CAME</p>

<p>2373
01:48:02,876 –&gt; 01:48:07,714
IN, BUT THERE WAS TWO OR THREE</p>

<p>2374
01:48:04,510 –&gt; 01:48:11,317
DAYS THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN.</p>

<p>2375
01:48:07,781 –&gt; 01:48:13,253
WHEN JAY POWELL ACTED AS HE DID,</p>

<p>2376
01:48:11,384 –&gt; 01:48:14,887
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.</p>

<p>2377
01:48:13,320 –&gt; 01:48:18,824
I MEAN, I SHOULD SAY THE FED</p>

<p>2378
01:48:14,954 –&gt; 01:48:21,794
ACTED AS THEY DID, BUT THEY</p>

<p>2379
01:48:18,891 –&gt; 01:48:23,696
MOVED WITH SPEED AND A</p>

<p>2380
01:48:21,861 –&gt; 01:48:27,333
DECISIVENESS ON MARCH 23rd THAT</p>

<p>2381
01:48:23,763 –&gt; 01:48:29,001
CHANGED THE SITUATION WHERE THE</p>

<p>2382
01:48:27,400 –&gt; 01:48:31,037
ECONOMY HAD STOPPED, THE</p>

<p>2383
01:48:29,068 –&gt; 01:48:31,471
GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET WAS EVEN</p>

<p>2384
01:48:31,104 –&gt; 01:48:32,738
DISRUPTED.</p>

<p>2385
01:48:31,538 –&gt; 01:48:36,909
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY PROBABLY</p>

<p>2386
01:48:32,805 –&gt; 01:48:40,346
COULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT WITH A</p>

<p>2387
01:48:36,976 –&gt; 01:48:42,281
DEBT OFFERING THE DAY BEFORE.</p>

<p>2388
01:48:40,413 –&gt; 01:48:44,116
DIDN’T GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY,</p>

<p>2389
01:48:42,348 –&gt; 01:48:45,852
BUT THERE WAS A RUN ON MONEY</p>

<p>2390
01:48:44,183 –&gt; 01:48:46,119
MARKET FUNDS, VERY SUBSTANTIAL</p>

<p>2391
01:48:45,919 –&gt; 01:48:47,553
RUN.</p>

<p>2392
01:48:46,186 –&gt; 01:48:48,788
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE</p>

<p>2393
01:48:47,620 –&gt; 01:48:51,023
NUMBERS – DAILY NUMBERS ON</p>

<p>2394
01:48:48,855 –&gt; 01:48:53,993
THAT, IT WAS A REPEAT OF</p>

<p>2395
01:48:51,090 –&gt; 01:48:56,329
SEPTEMBER 2008.</p>

<p>2396
01:48:54,060 –&gt; 01:48:58,698
AND THIS TIME I GIVE GREAT</p>

<p>2397
01:48:56,396 –&gt; 01:49:01,400
CREDIT TO WHAT BERNANKE AND</p>

<p>2398
01:48:58,765 –&gt; 01:49:03,736
PAULSEN DID, BUT THIS TIME THE</p>

<p>2399
01:49:01,467 –&gt; 01:49:05,338
FED KNEW THAT SAYING WHATEVER IT</p>

<p>2400
01:49:03,803 –&gt; 01:49:07,006
TAKES AND SAYING IT AND</p>

<p>2401
01:49:05,405 –&gt; 01:49:09,775
DEMONSTRATING IT, WHICH THEY DID</p>

<p>2402
01:49:07,073 –&gt; 01:49:11,310
ON MARCH 23rd, THEY TOOK A</p>

<p>2403
01:49:09,842 –&gt; 01:49:12,745
MARKET WHERE BERKSHIRE COULDN’T</p>

<p>2404
01:49:11,377 –&gt; 01:49:15,581
SELL BONDS ON THE DAY BEFORE AND</p>

<p>2405
01:49:12,812 –&gt; 01:49:18,517
TURNED IT INTO ONE WHERE</p>

<p>2406
01:49:15,648 –&gt; 01:49:23,155
CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES, A DAY OR</p>

<p>2407
01:49:18,584 –&gt; 01:49:24,657
TWO LATER, RECORD ISSUANCE OF</p>

<p>2408
01:49:23,222 –&gt; 01:49:27,794
CORPORATE DEBT.</p>

<p>2409
01:49:24,724 –&gt; 01:49:29,162
COMPANIES LOSING MONEY.</p>

<p>2410
01:49:27,861 –&gt; 01:49:29,429
COMPANIES WERE CLOSED.</p>

<p>2411
01:49:29,229 –&gt; 01:49:31,197
WHATEVER.</p>

<p>2412
01:49:29,496 –&gt; 01:49:31,965
IT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC MOVE</p>

<p>2413
01:49:31,264 –&gt; 01:49:33,633
THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE.</p>

<p>2414
01:49:32,032 –&gt; 01:49:35,801
AND AT THE TIME AS I REMEMBER</p>

<p>2415
01:49:33,699 –&gt; 01:49:37,970
THE CHAIRMAN SAYING, YOU KNOW,</p>

<p>2416
01:49:35,868 –&gt; 01:49:38,771
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE HELP ON THE</p>

<p>2417
01:49:38,037 –&gt; 01:49:41,807
FISCAL FRONT?</p>

<p>2418
01:49:38,838 –&gt; 01:49:43,943
AND THEN CONGRESS ACTED VERY,</p>

<p>2419
01:49:41,874 –&gt; 01:49:46,245
VERY BIG AGAIN IN 2008 AND NINE,</p>

<p>2420
01:49:44,010 –&gt; 01:49:48,014
THEY ARGUED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE</p>

<p>2421
01:49:46,312 –&gt; 01:49:52,118
DON’T WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO</p>

<p>2422
01:49:48,081 –&gt; 01:49:52,418
THOSE DIRTY BANKS, THAT SORT OF</p>

<p>2423
01:49:52,185 –&gt; 01:49:53,620
THING.</p>

<p>2424
01:49:52,485 –&gt; 01:49:54,120
THIS TIME THERE WAS NOBODY TO</p>

<p>2425
01:49:53,687 –&gt; 01:49:59,291
BLAME.</p>

<p>2426
01:49:54,187 –&gt; 01:50:00,727
THEY SAW WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND</p>

<p>2427
01:49:59,358 –&gt; 01:50:02,294
CONGRESS RESPONDED IN A WAY THAT</p>

<p>2428
01:50:00,794 –&gt; 01:50:04,230
WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT DID THE</p>

<p>2429
01:50:02,361 –&gt; 01:50:06,032
JOB AND IT DID – I THINK IT DID</p>

<p>2430
01:50:04,297 –&gt; 01:50:09,369
A BETTER JOB THAN EITHER THE FED</p>

<p>2431
01:50:06,099 –&gt; 01:50:09,736
OR THE TREASURY OR ANYBODY</p>

<p>2432
01:50:09,436 –&gt; 01:50:17,243
EXPECTED.</p>

<p>2433
01:50:09,803 –&gt; 01:50:19,378
THIS ECONOMY RIGHT NOW IS – 85%</p>

<p>2434
01:50:17,310 –&gt; 01:50:24,884
OF IT IS RUNNING IN SUPER HIGH</p>

<p>2435
01:50:19,445 –&gt; 01:50:26,085
GEAR AND PEOPLE CAN’T – AND</p>

<p>2436
01:50:24,951 –&gt; 01:50:27,353
YOU’RE SEEING SOME INFLATION AND</p>

<p>2437
01:50:26,152 –&gt; 01:50:29,389
ALL OF THAT.</p>

<p>2438
01:50:27,420 –&gt; 01:50:29,956
IT’S RESPONDED IN AN INCREDIBLE</p>

<p>2439
01:50:29,456 –&gt; 01:50:32,091
WAY.</p>

<p>2440
01:50:30,023 –&gt; 01:50:33,526
WE’VE LEARNED SOMETHING OUT OF</p>

<p>2441
01:50:32,158 –&gt; 01:50:34,927
2008 AND 9 BUT I DON’T THINK IT</p>

<p>2442
01:50:33,592 –&gt; 01:50:35,160
WAS A SURE THING THAT WOULD</p>

<p>2443
01:50:34,994 –&gt; 01:50:39,031
HAPPEN.</p>

<p>2444
01:50:35,227 –&gt; 01:50:40,666
THE ONE THING ABOUT BERKSHIRE,</p>

<p>2445
01:50:39,098 –&gt; 01:50:42,001
WE NEVER WANT – WE DON’T WANT</p>

<p>2446
01:50:40,733 –&gt; 01:50:43,036
TO DEPEND ON ANYBODY.</p>

<p>2447
01:50:42,068 –&gt; 01:50:44,904
WE’RE NOT A BANK.</p>

<p>2448
01:50:43,103 –&gt; 01:50:46,472
WE CAN’T GO TO THE FEDERAL</p>

<p>2449
01:50:44,970 –&gt; 01:50:48,641
RESERVE IF WE NEED MONEY.</p>

<p>2450
01:50:46,539 –&gt; 01:50:51,343
WE’VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT UNDER</p>

<p>2451
01:50:48,708 –&gt; 01:50:52,845
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ANY</p>

<p>2452
01:50:51,410 –&gt; 01:51:00,886
CIRCUMSTANCES WE CAN’T SOLVE</p>

<p>2453
01:50:52,912 –&gt; 01:51:04,356
NUCLEAR WAR AND WE CAN’T – BUT</p>

<p>2454
01:51:00,953 –&gt; 01:51:06,726
IN “A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE”</p>

<p>2455
01:51:04,423 –&gt; 01:51:07,393
SAID I DEPEND ON THE KINDNESS OF</p>

<p>2456
01:51:06,793 –&gt; 01:51:11,297
STRANGERS.</p>

<p>2457
01:51:07,460 –&gt; 01:51:12,465
YOU CAN’T DEPEND ON OTHERS IF</p>

<p>2458
01:51:11,364 –&gt; 01:51:13,733
THINGS ARE STOPPED.</p>

<p>2459
01:51:12,532 –&gt; 01:51:14,567
WE WERE SEEING IT IN THE MIDDLE</p>

<p>2460
01:51:13,800 –&gt; 01:51:16,002
OF MARCH.</p>

<p>2461
01:51:14,634 –&gt; 01:51:16,669
EVERYBODY WAS DRAWING DOWN THEIR</p>

<p>2462
01:51:16,069 –&gt; 01:51:18,805
CREDIT LINES.</p>

<p>2463
01:51:16,736 –&gt; 01:51:20,740
THE BANKS DID NOT EXPECT THAT.</p>

<p>2464
01:51:18,872 –&gt; 01:51:22,441
THEY JUST WEREN’T SURE THEY WERE</p>

<p>2465
01:51:20,807 –&gt; 01:51:24,343
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN</p>

<p>2466
01:51:22,508 –&gt; 01:51:24,543
THEIR CREDIT LINES TEN DAYS</p>

<p>2467
01:51:24,410 –&gt; 01:51:25,812
LATER.</p>

<p>2468
01:51:24,610 –&gt; 01:51:29,382
THEY DREW THEM DOWN.</p>

<p>2469
01:51:25,879 –&gt; 01:51:29,582
TOOK MONEY OUT OF MONEY MARKET</p>

<p>2470
01:51:29,449 –&gt; 01:51:32,218
FUNDS.</p>

<p>2471
01:51:29,649 –&gt; 01:51:34,020
WE GOT – I GIVE GREAT CREDIT ON</p>

<p>2472
01:51:32,285 –&gt; 01:51:34,754
THE MONETARY FISCAL SIDE WHAT</p>

<p>2473
01:51:34,087 –&gt; 01:51:35,955
WAS DONE.</p>

<p>2474
01:51:34,821 –&gt; 01:51:36,956
I DIDN’T THINK IT WAS A SURE</p>

<p>2475
01:51:36,022 –&gt; 01:51:38,758
THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN.</p>

<p>2476
01:51:37,023 –&gt; 01:51:39,058
I DIDN’T KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE</p>

<p>2477
01:51:38,825 –&gt; 01:51:41,393
IMPLEMENTED.</p>

<p>2478
01:51:39,125 –&gt; 01:51:45,030
I THINK IT’S WORKED BETTER THAN</p>

<p>2479
01:51:41,460 –&gt; 01:51:47,399
JUST ABOUT ANYBODY HAS EXPECTED</p>

<p>2480
01:51:45,097 –&gt; 01:51:50,636
AND I THINK – WELL, YOU’RE</p>

<p>2481
01:51:47,466 –&gt; 01:51:51,837
SEEING IT NOW.</p>

<p>2482
01:51:50,703 –&gt; 01:51:52,605
CHARLIE’S GOT SOME VIEWS ON</p>

THIS, TOO.</p>

<p>2484

WE SHOULDN’T LEAVE HIM OUT OF</p>

<p>2485

<p>2487
01:52:02,648 –&gt; 01:52:06,218
ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE SMART</p>

<p>2488

THERE’S ALWAYS SOME PERSON THAT</p>

01:57:53,132 –&gt; 01:57:58,337
90% IN AN S&amp;P 500 INDEX FUND.</p>

<p>2649
01:57:56,435 –&gt; 01:58:02,541
NOW THE INDEX FUND PEOPLE</p>

<p>2650
01:57:58,404 –&gt; 01:58:04,676
NATURALLY HAVE STARTED OVER THE</p>

<p>2651
01:58:02,608 –&gt; 01:58:06,111
TIME THEY MARKET MORE AND MORE</p>

<p>2652
01:58:04,743 –&gt; 01:58:07,079
PRODUCTS THAT GO TO OTHER</p>

<p>2653
01:58:06,178 –&gt; 01:58:08,614
INDICES AND EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>2654
01:58:07,146 –&gt; 01:58:09,982
THEY’RE REALLY STARTING TO SAY</p>

<p>2655
01:58:08,681 –&gt; 01:58:13,452
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, THEY’RE</p>

<p>2656
01:58:10,049 –&gt; 01:58:15,821
SAYING, WELL, YOU CAN PICK WHAT</p>

<p>2657
01:58:13,518 –&gt; 01:58:16,088
TO INVEST IN AND WE’LL SELL YOU</p>

<p>2658
01:58:15,888 –&gt; 01:58:18,590
SOMETHING.</p>

<p>2659
01:58:16,155 –&gt; 01:58:21,727
WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH,</p>

<p>2660
01:58:18,657 –&gt; 01:58:22,928
YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING IN</p>

<p>2661
01:58:21,794 –&gt; 01:58:24,630
STOCKS.</p>

<p>2662
01:58:22,995 –&gt; 01:58:28,367
SO I NAMED THE 500 INDEXES ONE</p>

<p>2663
01:58:24,697 –&gt; 01:58:30,269
BUT IT’S A TINY PORTION BUT IT</p>

<p>2664
01:58:28,434 –&gt; 01:58:30,569
WILL BE – IT WILL BE HER</p>

<p>2665
01:58:30,336 –&gt; 01:58:31,937
LIVELIHOOD.</p>

<p>2666
01:58:30,636 –&gt; 01:58:34,039
SHE’LL HAVE ALL THE MONEY SHE</p>

<p>2667
01:58:32,004 –&gt; 01:58:35,107
NEEDS AND WAY BEYOND IT AND</p>

<p>2668
01:58:34,106 –&gt; 01:58:40,980
THAT’S THAT.</p>

<p>2669
01:58:35,174 –&gt; 01:58:42,915
I DON’T MIND HAVING THE 99.7%.</p>

<p>2670
01:58:41,047 –&gt; 01:58:48,854
A LARGE PORTION OF IT, ASSUMING</p>

<p>2671
01:58:42,982 –&gt; 01:58:50,322
THE LAW’S THE SAME AS NOW GO TO</p>

<p>2672
01:58:48,921 –&gt; 01:58:54,460
PHILANTHROPY, IT WILL BE KEPT IN</p>

ANDREW DICKSON IN THE U.K.</p>

<p>2677
01:58:58,864 –&gt; 01:59:02,334
HE SAYS, MY QUESTION IS IN</p>

<p>2678
01:59:00,599 –&gt; 01:59:03,702
RELATION TO THE OIL AND GAS</p>

<p>2679
01:59:02,401 –&gt; 01:59:04,370
BUSINESS AND YOUR PURCHASE OF</p>

<p>2680
01:59:03,769 –&gt; 01:59:06,238
CHEVRON STOCK.</p>

<p>2681
01:59:04,437 –&gt; 01:59:08,207
WHEN BEING ASKED A QUESTION ON</p>

<p>2682
01:59:06,305 –&gt; 01:59:09,141
TOBACCO STOCKS IN 1997 YOU</p>

MENTIONED THAT INDIVIDUALS AND</p>

<p>2684
01:59:09,208 –&gt; 01:59:12,144
COMPANIES OCCASIONALLY HAVE TO</p>

<p>2685
01:59:11,076 –&gt; 01:59:12,945
DRAW MORAL LINES ABOUT WHAT</p>

<p>2686
01:59:12,211 –&gt; 01:59:14,547
THEY’RE WILLING TO DO.</p>

<p>2687
01:59:13,012 –&gt; 01:59:16,315
YOU STATED AT THE TIME THAT YOU</p>

<p>2688
01:59:14,613 –&gt; 01:59:18,217
WERE NOT COMFORTABLE IN MAKING A</p>

<p>2689
01:59:16,382 –&gt; 01:59:19,852
BIG COMMITMENT IN TOBACCO STOCKS</p>

<p>2690
01:59:18,284 –&gt; 01:59:21,020
AND YOU WERE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT</p>

<p>2691
01:59:19,919 –&gt; 01:59:22,588
THEIR PROSPECTS.</p>

<p>2692

PASSING ON A PRIVATE TOBACCO</p>

<p>2694

DEAL THAT YOU KNEW WAS A CINCH</p>

<p>2695
01:59:25,824 –&gt; 01:59:28,561
AND YOU HAD NO REGRETS SAYING NO</p>

<p>2696
01:59:27,827 –&gt; 01:59:30,563
TO THE TRANSACTION.</p>

<p>2697
01:59:28,628 –&gt; 01:59:32,130
I’M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE OIL</p>

<p>2698
01:59:30,629 –&gt; 01:59:34,767
AND GAS BUSINESS HAS THE SAME</p>

<p>2699

KNOWN NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES AS</p>

<p>2700

<p>2701
01:59:36,369 –&gt; 01:59:39,939
WITH TOBACCO THE CAUSE AND</p>

<p>2702
01:59:37,803 –&gt; 01:59:40,339
EFFECT IS DIRECT, OBVIOUS AND</p>

<p>2703
01:59:40,006 –&gt; 01:59:42,841
MEASURABLE.</p>

<p>2704
01:59:40,406 –&gt; 01:59:45,544
WITH HYDROCARBONS THE SOCIETAL</p>

<p>2705
01:59:42,908 –&gt; 01:59:46,912
COSTS AN BENEFITS ARE FAR MORE</p>

<p>2706
01:59:45,611 –&gt; 01:59:49,148
COMPLEX TO DEBATE.</p>

<p>2707
01:59:46,979 –&gt; 01:59:50,916
IT’S DRAWING THEIR LINES IN SUCH</p>

<p>2708
01:59:49,214 –&gt; 01:59:52,551
A WAY THAT THEIR PAINTING DOES</p>

<p>2709
01:59:50,983 –&gt; 01:59:52,851
NOT INCLUDE HYDROCARBONS,</p>

<p>2710
01:59:52,618 –&gt; 01:59:56,755
PERIOD.</p>

<p>2711
01:59:52,918 –&gt; 01:59:59,458
 MY QUESTION IS AS THE ALARMISM</p>

<p>2712
01:59:56,822 –&gt; 02:00:01,894
FROM THE CLIMATE COMMUNITY</p>

<p>2713

BECOME PERVASIVE ENOUGH TO WHERE</p>

<p>2714
02:00:01,961 –&gt; 02:00:10,937
IT’S IRRATIONAL.</p>

<p>2715
02:00:08,267 –&gt; 02:00:12,671
IS THIS BECOMING AN OVERLY</p>

<p>2716
02:00:11,003 –&gt; 02:00:14,974
EXPENSIVE TASK?</p>

<p>2717
02:00:12,738 –&gt; 02:00:16,708
CAN WE GATHER FROM YOUR PURCHASE</p>

<p>2718
02:00:15,041 –&gt; 02:00:17,943
OF CHEVRON STOCK YOU DO NOT</p>

BELIEVE THE HOWLING FROM</p>

<p>2720

SOCIETY, REGULATORS AND</p>

<p>2721
02:00:19,978 –&gt; 02:00:24,850
POLITICIANS WILL IMPACT AND</p>

CAN CONSUMERS ASSUME THIS CAN</p>

GENERATE A SUFFICIENT RETURN ON</p>

<p>2727

TEN-WORD ANSWER TO THAT.</p>

<p>2728

I CAN’T REMEMBER ALL OF THE</p>

<p>2729

QUESTIONS THAT WERE THERE, BUT I</p>

<p>2730
02:00:44,937 –&gt; 02:00:48,206
WOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE</p>

<p>2731

ON THE EXTREMES OF BOTH SIDES</p>

<p>2732
02:00:48,273 –&gt; 02:00:54,046
ARE A LITTLE NUTS.</p>

<p>2733
02:00:51,777 –&gt; 02:00:55,414
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE ALL THE</p>

<p>2734
02:00:54,113 –&gt; 02:00:55,948
HYDROCARBONS BANNED IN THREE</p>

<p>2735
02:00:55,481 –&gt; 02:00:57,449
YEARS.</p>

<p>2736
02:00:56,015 –&gt; 02:00:59,117
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN’T WANT A</p>

<p>2737
02:00:57,516 –&gt; 02:01:01,887
WORLD – IT WOULDN’T WORK AND ON</p>

<p>2738
02:00:59,184 –&gt; 02:01:03,322
THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW, WHAT’S</p>

<p>2739
02:01:01,954 –&gt; 02:01:05,891
HAPPENING WILL BE ADAPTED TO</p>

<p>2740
02:01:03,389 –&gt; 02:01:10,229
OVER TIME JUST AS WE’VE ADAPTED</p>

<p>2741
02:01:05,958 –&gt; 02:01:11,830
TO ALL KINDS OF THINGS.</p>

<p>2742
02:01:10,296 –&gt; 02:01:12,231
I’M INTERESTED IN THE QUOTE FROM</p>

<p>2743
02:01:11,897 –&gt; 02:01:13,232
1997.</p>

<p>2744
02:01:12,298 –&gt; 02:01:15,868
WE’VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.</p>

<p>2745
02:01:13,299 –&gt; 02:01:19,571
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM OWNING COSTCO</p>

<p>2746
02:01:15,935 –&gt; 02:01:21,840
OR WALMART AND A SUBSTANTIAL</p>

<p>2747
02:01:19,638 –&gt; 02:01:23,976
NUMBER OF THEIR STORES.</p>

<p>2748
02:01:21,907 –&gt; 02:01:26,178
YOU KNOW, THEY SELL CIGARETTES.</p>

<p>2749
02:01:24,043 –&gt; 02:01:26,878
BIG ITEM.</p>

<p>2750
02:01:26,245 –&gt; 02:01:27,446
IT’S SOMETHING THAT BRINGS</p>

<p>2751
02:01:26,945 –&gt; 02:01:30,649
PEOPLE IN.</p>

<p>2752
02:01:27,513 –&gt; 02:01:33,319
THEY KNOW THE PRICE OF</p>

<p>2753
02:01:30,715 –&gt; 02:01:34,053
CIGARETTES AND THEY PUT THEM OUT</p>

<p>2754
02:01:33,386 –&gt; 02:01:35,421
FRONT.</p>

<p>2755
02:01:34,120 –&gt; 02:01:37,089
IT’S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION.</p>

<p>2756
02:01:35,487 –&gt; 02:01:39,592
WE MADE THAT DECISION A LONG</p>

<p>2757
02:01:37,156 –&gt; 02:01:40,893
TIME AGO WHEN WE WENT TO MEMPHIS</p>

<p>2758
02:01:39,658 –&gt; 02:01:43,095
AND WE LOOKED AT A BUSINESS THAT</p>

<p>2759
02:01:40,960 –&gt; 02:01:44,996
WAS A VERY, VERY GOOD BUSINESS.</p>

<p>2760
02:01:43,162 –&gt; 02:01:46,398
IT WAS MUCH LESS HARMFUL, AT</p>

<p>2761
02:01:45,063 –&gt; 02:01:47,599
LEAST FROM EVERYTHING I COULD</p>

<p>2762
02:01:46,465 –&gt; 02:01:51,970
FIND OUT.</p>

<p>2763
02:01:47,666 –&gt; 02:01:53,372
IT WAS MUCH LESS HARMFUL THAN</p>

<p>2764
02:01:52,037 –&gt; 02:01:53,639
SMOKING TOBACCO, CHEWING TOBACCO</p>

<p>2765
02:01:53,439 –&gt; 02:01:54,873
WAS.</p>

<p>2766
02:01:53,706 –&gt; 02:01:56,408
THESE WERE DECENT PEOPLE.</p>

<p>2767
02:01:54,940 –&gt; 02:01:58,243
THEY WERE RUNNING A LEGAL</p>

<p>2768
02:01:56,475 –&gt; 02:01:59,010
BUSINESS AND THEY ALL CHEWED</p>

<p>2769
02:01:58,310 –&gt; 02:02:00,545
TOBACCO THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>2770
02:01:59,077 –&gt; 02:02:02,647
THEY TOLD ME THAT THEIR MOTHER</p>

<p>2771
02:02:00,612 –&gt; 02:02:03,782
WAS 100 AND CHEWING TOBACCO AND</p>

<p>2772
02:02:02,714 –&gt; 02:02:05,584
ALL OF THESE THINGS.</p>

<p>2773
02:02:03,849 –&gt; 02:02:07,919
CHARLIE AND I DID GO DOWN IN THE</p>

<p>2774
02:02:05,651 –&gt; 02:02:09,588
LOBBY OF THAT HOTEL AND WE JUST</p>

<p>2775
02:02:07,986 –&gt; 02:02:10,823
SAID TO OURSELVES, THIS IS</p>

<p>2776
02:02:09,655 –&gt; 02:02:11,790
PROBABLY THE BEST BUSINESS WE’VE</p>

<p>2777
02:02:10,890 –&gt; 02:02:14,860
EVER SEEN.</p>

<p>2778
02:02:11,857 –&gt; 02:02:17,062
I CALLED MY THEN SON-IN-LAW, HE</p>

<p>2779
02:02:14,927 –&gt; 02:02:19,932
HAD STUDIED CHEWING TOBACCO AND</p>

<p>2780
02:02:17,129 –&gt; 02:02:21,700
ITS EFFECTS WHEN HE WAS WORKING</p>

<p>2781
02:02:19,998 –&gt; 02:02:26,872
FOR A NADER RELATED ORGANIZATION</p>

<p>2782
02:02:21,767 –&gt; 02:02:29,208
AND WE DECIDED NOT TO DO IT.</p>

<p>2783
02:02:26,939 –&gt; 02:02:31,343
YOU KNOW, I SEE – I USED TO SEE</p>

<p>2784
02:02:29,275 –&gt; 02:02:32,978
ADS IN OUR PAPER FROM FINANCIAL</p>

<p>2785
02:02:31,410 –&gt; 02:02:33,679
COMPANIES WHERE I KNEW THEY WERE</p>

<p>2786
02:02:33,045 –&gt; 02:02:37,383
TERRIBLE.</p>

<p>2787
02:02:33,746 –&gt; 02:02:38,517
IT’S A VERY TOUGH THING TO</p>

<p>2788
02:02:37,449 –&gt; 02:02:39,385
DECIDE WHETHER YOU GET IN OR OUT</p>

<p>2789
02:02:38,584 –&gt; 02:02:41,720
OF A BUSINESS.</p>

<p>2790
02:02:39,451 –&gt; 02:02:43,689
VERY TOUGH TIME TO DECIDE WHAT</p>

<p>2791
02:02:41,787 –&gt; 02:02:44,490
COMPANIES BENEFIT SOCIETIES MORE</p>

<p>2792
02:02:43,756 –&gt; 02:02:46,325
THAN OTHERS.</p>

<p>2793
02:02:44,557 –&gt; 02:02:49,061
I DON’T KNOW WHETHER I THINK</p>

<p>2794
02:02:46,391 –&gt; 02:02:50,529
CHEVRON’S BENEFITTED SOCIETIES</p>

<p>2795
02:02:49,128 –&gt; 02:02:53,833
IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS AND I THINK</p>

<p>2796
02:02:50,596 –&gt; 02:02:55,100
IT WILL CONTINUE TO.</p>

<p>2797
02:02:53,899 –&gt; 02:03:01,306
I DO THINK THAT THE WORLD’S</p>

<p>2798
02:02:55,166 –&gt; 02:03:04,510
MOVING AWAY FROM THEM, TOO.</p>

<p>2799
02:03:01,373 –&gt; 02:03:06,077
THAT COULD CHANGE.</p>

<p>2800
02:03:04,577 –&gt; 02:03:07,412
I DON’T LIKE MAKING THE MORAL</p>

02:03:07,479 –&gt; 02:03:11,416
ACTUALLY RUNNING THE BUSINESSES,</p>

<p>2803
02:03:08,914 –&gt; 02:03:13,118
BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT</p>

<p>2804
02:03:11,483 –&gt; 02:03:18,624
EVERY BUSINESS THAT YOU KNEW</p>

<p>2805

WHAT YOU WOULDN’T LIKE AND, YOU</p>

KNOW, MEAT PACK ERS, YOU KNOW.</p>

<p>2807
02:03:26,098 –&gt; 02:03:29,835
IF YOU EXPECT PERFECTION IN YOUR</p>

SPOUSE OR YOUR FRIENDS OR IN</p>

FIND IT.</p>

WHAT YOU ELECT TO DO YOURSELF,</p>

<p>2812

IF YOU OWN AN INDEX FUND, YOU</p>

OWN – BELIEVE ME, CHEVRON IS</p>

<p>2814
02:03:41,313 –&gt; 02:03:48,787
NOT AN EVIL COMPANY IN THE LEAST</p>

<p>2815
02:03:44,884 –&gt; 02:03:49,955
AND I HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT</p>

<p>2816
02:03:48,854 –&gt; 02:03:51,290
OWNING – IN THE LEAST ABOUT</p>

<p>2817
02:03:50,022 –&gt; 02:03:52,925
OWNING CHEVRON.</p>

<p>2818
02:03:51,357 –&gt; 02:03:55,193
AND IF WE OWNED THE ENTIRE</p>

<p>2819
02:03:52,992 –&gt; 02:03:56,094
BUSINESS, I WOULD NOT FEEL</p>

<p>2820
02:03:55,260 –&gt; 02:03:57,062
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT BEING IN</p>

<p>2821
02:03:56,161 –&gt; 02:03:57,295
THAT BUSINESS.</p>

<p>2822

YOUNG MAN MARRIES INTO YOUR</p>

LOTS OF EMAILS THAT CAME IN ON</p>

BERKSHIRE IS SUCH A FORCE FOR</p>

<p>2853
02:04:59,424 –&gt; 02:05:03,929
GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL</p>

<p>2854

<p>2861

LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>2862
02:05:17,676 –&gt; 02:05:24,349
HAS DONE AS OPPOSED TO – IN</p>

<p>2863

TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL.</p>

<p>2864
02:05:24,416 –&gt; 02:05:27,986
I WOULD SAY THIS.</p>

<p>2865
02:05:26,552 –&gt; 02:05:29,655
IT’S VERY INTERESTING.</p>

<p>2866
02:05:28,053 –&gt; 02:05:31,723
WITH EVERYTHING THAT’S BEING</p>

<p>2867
02:05:29,722 –&gt; 02:05:34,426
RELEASED, I THINK WE HAVE OVER 1</p>

MILLION SHAREHOLDERS.</p>

<p>2869

CAN’T BE SURE BECAUSE OF THE</p>

STREET NAME AND DUPLICATE</p>

I’VE HAD – AND I GET THE</p>

<p>2879
02:05:57,582 –&gt; 02:06:04,222
OUR VOTE ON THIS, AS YOU’LL SEE</p>

<p>2880
02:06:01,754 –&gt; 02:06:06,024
LATER, IS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY</p>

<p>2881
02:06:04,289 –&gt; 02:06:07,993
THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>2882
02:06:06,091 –&gt; 02:06:08,794
WITH THEIR OWN MONEY VOTED</p>

<p>2883
02:06:08,060 –&gt; 02:06:10,361
AGAINST THOSE.</p>

<p>2884
02:06:08,861 –&gt; 02:06:12,097
MOST OF THE VOTES FOR IT WERE</p>

<p>2885
02:06:10,428 –&gt; 02:06:13,999
BY – CAME FROM PEOPLE WHO NEVER</p>

<p>2886

INTO BERKSHIRE.</p>

<p>2888
02:06:16,769 –&gt; 02:06:20,639
AND SO THEY – AND I DON’T THINK</p>

<p>2889
02:06:19,004 –&gt; 02:06:22,007
THEY READ OUR ANNUAL REPORTS AND</p>

<p>2890
02:06:20,706 –&gt; 02:06:23,875
I DON’T THINK THEY READ THE</p>

<p>2891
02:06:22,073 –&gt; 02:06:25,610
REPORTS OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY</p>

<p>2892

<p>2893
02:06:25,677 –&gt; 02:06:29,948
KNOW – YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT</p>

<p>2894
02:06:27,345 –&gt; 02:06:32,484
WHAT WE’RE DOING IN HIGH VOLTAGE</p>

<p>2895
02:06:30,015 –&gt; 02:06:34,519
TRANSMISSION, WE’RE DOING MORE</p>

<p>2896
02:06:32,551 –&gt; 02:06:34,752
THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY IN THE</p>

THE GOVERNMENT’S GOING TO DO,</p>

<p>2900
02:06:37,823 –&gt; 02:06:45,464
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS, YOU KNOW?</p>

<p>2901
02:06:42,795 –&gt; 02:06:47,199
WE HAVE A RECORD THAT OVERALL IS</p>

<p>2902
02:06:45,531 –&gt; 02:06:49,067
INCREDIBLY GOOD, BUT WE HAVE A</p>

02:06:47,265 –&gt; 02:06:50,635
GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS, JUST</p>

<p>2904

GENERALLY, AND THEY’RE NICE</p>

<p>2905
02:06:50,702 –&gt; 02:06:54,973
PEOPLE BUT THEY WANT US TO</p>

<p>2906
02:06:52,237 –&gt; 02:06:57,075
ANSWER A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS</p>

<p>2907

FIGURES.</p>

<p>2912

IT.</p>

<p>2918
02:07:16,462 –&gt; 02:07:22,067
IT’S ASININE FRANKLY IN MY VIEW.</p>

<p>2919
02:07:18,831 –&gt; 02:07:23,602
WE DO SOME OTHER ASININE THINGS</p>

<p>2920
02:07:22,134 –&gt; 02:07:24,469
BECAUSE WE’RE REQUIRED TO DO</p>

<p>2921

THEM.</p>

<p>2922

AND EVERYTHING, THEY’D HAND ME</p>

<p>2955
02:08:35,340 –&gt; 02:08:37,175
SOMETHING AND I KNOW THE ANSWER</p>

<p>2956
02:08:36,508 –&gt; 02:08:38,643
TO IT ALREADY.</p>

<p>2957
02:08:37,242 –&gt; 02:08:40,312
IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>2958
02:08:38,710 –&gt; 02:08:43,348
THEY’VE GOT THE MONEY THEY NEED.</p>

<p>2959
02:08:40,379 –&gt; 02:08:44,516
SO WE DON’T DO THINGS JUST</p>

<p>2960
02:08:43,415 –&gt; 02:08:45,950
BECAUSE WE’VE GOT A DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>2961
02:08:44,583 –&gt; 02:08:48,753
OF THIS OR A DEPARTMENT OF THAT</p>

<p>2962
02:08:46,017 –&gt; 02:08:51,957
AND WE DON’T WANT TO SET UP A</p>

<p>2963
02:08:48,820 –&gt; 02:08:54,626
LOT OF DEPARTMENTS LIKE THAT.</p>

<p>2964
02:08:52,024 –&gt; 02:08:56,427
WHAT’S IMPORTANT IS WHAT WE’RE</p>

<p>2965
02:08:54,693 –&gt; 02:08:58,597
DOING – WELL, PRIMARILY</p>

<p>2966
02:08:56,494 –&gt; 02:08:59,264
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND THE</p>

<p>2967
02:08:58,664 –&gt; 02:09:02,000
RAILROAD.</p>

<p>2968
02:08:59,331 –&gt; 02:09:07,172
I’LL LET GREG TELL YOU ABOUT</p>

<p>2969
02:09:02,067 –&gt; 02:09:10,075
THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND.</p>

<p>2970
02:09:07,239 –&gt; 02:09:11,709
BUT – p» I DON’T THINK WE THI</p>

<p>2971
02:09:10,142 –&gt; 02:09:13,344
KNOW THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THESE</p>

<p>2972
02:09:11,776 –&gt; 02:09:14,279
QUESTIONS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING</p>

<p>2973
02:09:13,411 –&gt; 02:09:16,014
AND SO FORTH.</p>

<p>2974
02:09:14,346 –&gt; 02:09:18,049
PEOPLE WHO ASK THE QUESTIONS</p>

<p>2975
02:09:16,081 –&gt; 02:09:19,918
THINK THEY KNOW THE ANSWERS,</p>

<p>2976
02:09:18,116 –&gt; 02:09:22,020
WE’RE JUST MORE MODEST.</p>

<p>2977
02:09:19,985 –&gt; 02:09:23,788</p>

<p>2978
02:09:22,087 –&gt; 02:09:25,424
ANSWER, IN TERMS OF THE REPORTS</p>

<p>2979
02:09:23,855 –&gt; 02:09:27,392
WE WOULD – WE WOULD NOT COLLECT</p>

<p>2980
02:09:25,490 –&gt; 02:09:30,729
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT DON’T</p>

<p>2981
02:09:27,459 –&gt; 02:09:33,364
MEAN ANYTHING TO US TO SATISFY</p>

<p>2982
02:09:30,795 –&gt; 02:09:35,100
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DON’T KNOW</p>

<p>2983
02:09:33,431 –&gt; 02:09:37,535
WHAT THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>

<p>2984
02:09:35,167 –&gt; 02:09:38,804
IN MANY CASES I CAN TELL THEY</p>

<p>2985
02:09:37,602 –&gt; 02:09:41,773
HAVEN’T READ OUR REPORT.</p>

<p>2986
02:09:38,871 –&gt; 02:09:43,141
WE, AS I POINT OUT IN THE ANNUAL</p>

<p>2987
02:09:41,840 –&gt; 02:09:44,309
REPORT, I NEVER – NOBODY WOULD</p>

<p>2988
02:09:43,208 –&gt; 02:09:46,945
HAVE GUESSED IT.</p>

<p>2989
02:09:44,376 –&gt; 02:09:48,213
PEOPLE THINK WE’RE A BUNCH OF</p>

<p>2990
02:09:47,012 –&gt; 02:09:49,681
GUYS THAT OWN STOCKS AND ALL OF</p>

<p>2991
02:09:48,280 –&gt; 02:09:55,086
THAT SORT OF THING.</p>

<p>2992
02:09:49,748 –&gt; 02:09:56,388
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY OWNS BY GAP</p>

<p>2993
02:09:55,153 –&gt; 02:09:58,122
ACCOUNTING MORE PROPERTY PLANT</p>

INFRASTRUCTURE.</p>

02:10:07,299 –&gt; 02:10:10,335
ACCOUNTING THAN ANYBODY ELSE,</p>

<p>3001
02:10:09,234 –&gt; 02:10:12,704
MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE COMPANIES</p>

<p>3002
02:10:10,402 –&gt; 02:10:14,839
ON THE LIST OF LARGEST COMPANIES</p>

<p>3003
02:10:12,771 –&gt; 02:10:15,774
AND WE’VE GOT IT BY A</p>

<p>3004

SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN.</p>

<p>3005
02:10:15,841 –&gt; 02:10:22,380
SO WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN WHAT</p>

<p>3006
02:10:18,477 –&gt; 02:10:23,982
MAKES THIS COUNTRY MOVE AND</p>

<p>3007

15% OF THE INTERSTATE GOODS MOVE</p>

ON OUR RAILROAD.</p>

<p>3010
02:10:27,853 –&gt; 02:10:36,127
WE’RE BUILDING TRANSMISSION AND</p>

<p>3011
02:10:29,621 –&gt; 02:10:38,796
WE STARTED IN 2006 OR 7 PLANNING</p>

<p>3012
02:10:36,194 –&gt; 02:10:40,565
HOW WE WOULD CLOSE COAL PLANTS</p>

<p>3013
02:10:38,863 –&gt; 02:10:42,467
BUT YOU CAN’T CLOSE COAL PLANTS</p>

<p>3014
02:10:40,631 –&gt; 02:10:45,704
UNTIL YOU GET THE ELECTRICITY</p>

<p>3015
02:10:42,534 –&gt; 02:10:45,971
FROM WHERE IT’S GENERATED TO THE</p>

<p>3016
02:10:45,771 –&gt; 02:10:51,543
CUSTOMER.</p>

<p>3017
02:10:46,038 –&gt; 02:10:57,082
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GENERATE IT</p>

<p>3018
02:10:51,609 –&gt; 02:11:00,685
IN WYOMING – THAT’S THE WAY IT</p>

<p>3019
02:10:57,148 –&gt; 02:11:01,086
WAS DONE 350 YEARS AGO, 75 YEAR</p>

<p>3020
02:11:00,752 –&gt; 02:11:02,453
AGO.</p>

<p>3021
02:11:01,153 –&gt; 02:11:04,188
THERE’S NO REASON TO HAVE THE</p>

WIND BLOWING IN WYOMING AND</p>

<p>3023

TRYING TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS IN</p>

LAS VEGAS.</p>

<p>3025
02:11:06,658 –&gt; 02:11:11,796
WE WENT ON THE PLAN A LOT</p>

<p>3026
02:11:08,460 –&gt; 02:11:12,230
EARLIER THAN PEOPLE WERE TALKING</p>

<p>3027
02:11:11,863 –&gt; 02:11:13,531
ABOUT.</p>

<p>3028
02:11:12,297 –&gt; 02:11:15,267
WE SAID 16 BILLION OR WHATEVER</p>

<p>3029
02:11:13,598 –&gt; 02:11:15,534
IT WAS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT</p>

<p>3030
02:11:15,334 –&gt; 02:11:17,468
UNDERWAY.</p>

<p>3031
02:11:15,601 –&gt; 02:11:20,972
WE JUST ADDED 2 BILLION SINCE</p>

<p>3032
02:11:17,535 –&gt; 02:11:22,840
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THERE’S NO</p>

THAT IT’S A FUNDAMENTAL RISK AND</p>

<p>3078
02:12:56,701 –&gt; 02:12:59,170
WE DISCUSS WHAT GOOD POLICY</p>

<p>3079
02:12:58,903 –&gt; 02:13:03,274
WOULD BE.</p>

<p>3080
02:12:59,237 –&gt; 02:13:04,609
WE DISCUSSED INNOVATION.</p>

<p>3081
02:13:03,341 –&gt; 02:13:05,677
WE DISCUSSED MARKET</p>

<p>3082
02:13:04,676 –&gt; 02:13:07,612
TRANSFORMATION AND THE</p>

<p>3083

IMPORTANCE OF SETTING TARGETS AT</p>

THAT POINT IN TIME.</p>

<p>3085

OUR INDUSTRY.</p>

<p>3087
02:13:14,753 –&gt; 02:13:19,357
THEN SINCE THEN EACH YEAR WE’VE</p>

<p>3088
02:13:16,554 –&gt; 02:13:21,692
PRESENTED REALLY A PLAN AND A</p>

<p>3089

STRATEGY AROUND HOW EACH OF OUR</p>

OUR REGULATED ENTITIES, HOW</p>

<p>3092
02:13:26,164 –&gt; 02:13:30,068
THEY’RE GOING TO TRANSFORM.</p>

<p>3093
02:13:28,033 –&gt; 02:13:32,404
THE WHOLE TRANSFORMATION HAS</p>

<p>3094
02:13:30,135 –&gt; 02:13:35,206
BEEN AROUND DECARBONIZATION.</p>

<p>3095
02:13:32,471 –&gt; 02:13:38,943
MANAGING THAT RISK ON BEHALF OF</p>

<p>3096
02:13:35,273 –&gt; 02:13:43,515
OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN MANY STATES,</p>

<p>3097
02:13:39,010 –&gt; 02:13:44,416
CUSTOMERS WE SEARCH, AND FOR</p>

<p>3098

ALREADY.</p>

<p>3103
02:13:48,853 –&gt; 02:13:54,992
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION</p>

<p>3104
02:13:52,824 –&gt; 02:13:57,195
FIRST AND THAT FOUNDATION IS</p>

<p>3105
02:13:55,059 –&gt; 02:13:58,329
AROUND BUILDING THE HIGH</p>

SHAREHOLDERS, I REALLY BELIEVE</p>

<p>3285

<p>3296
02:21:38,389 –&gt; 02:21:42,126

<p>3564
02:31:10,427 –&gt; 02:31:13,864
I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND TALKED</p>

<p>3565
02:31:12,429 –&gt; 02:31:14,598
TO GREG ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW</p>

<p>3566
02:31:13,931 –&gt; 02:31:16,700
BEST TO PROCEED.</p>

<p>3567
02:31:14,665 –&gt; 02:31:17,534
SO THERE’S THAT THAT HAPPENS</p>

<p>3568
02:31:16,767 –&gt; 02:31:17,801
DURING THE COURSE OF THE</p>

<p>3569
02:31:17,601 –&gt; 02:31:23,440
QUARTER.</p>

<p>3570
02:31:17,868 –&gt; 02:31:25,642
EVERY QUARTER WE EXCHANGE NOTES.</p>

<p>3571
02:31:23,507 –&gt; 02:31:26,577
WE HAVE A PERFECTLY</p>

<p>3572
02:31:25,709 –&gt; 02:31:27,944
WELL-FUNCTIONING RELATIONSHIP</p>

<p>3573
02:31:26,644 –&gt; 02:31:29,713
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, AND I</p>

<p>3574
02:31:28,011 –&gt; 02:31:30,180
HOPE IT REMAINS THAT WAY.</p>

<p>3575
02:31:29,780 –&gt; 02:31:31,048

    <p>YES.</p>

<p>3577
02:31:31,115 –&gt; 02:31:36,353
WELL, AJIT, WELL SAID.</p>

<p>3578
02:31:33,017 –&gt; 02:31:38,956
AND AS HE TOUCHED ON, WARREN AND</p>

<p>3579
02:31:36,420 –&gt; 02:31:39,690
CHARLIE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL</p>

<p>3580
02:31:39,023 –&gt; 02:31:40,024
RELAT</p>

<p>3581
02:31:39,757 –&gt; 02:31:41,124
RELATIONSHIP.</p>

<p>3582
02:31:40,090 –&gt; 02:31:42,126
VERY PROUD OF THE RELATIONSHIP</p>

<p>3583
02:31:41,191 –&gt; 02:31:44,227
I’VE HAD.</p>

<p>3584
02:31:42,193 –&gt; 02:31:45,496
AS AJIT TOUCHED ON, IT’S</p>

<p>3585
02:31:44,294 –&gt; 02:31:47,397
DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS.</p>

<p>3586
02:31:45,563 –&gt; 02:31:50,834
WE’VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OR</p>

<p>3587
02:31:47,464 –&gt; 02:31:56,607
I’VE SEEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE</p>

<p>3588
02:31:50,901 –&gt; 02:31:57,941
HOW AJIT’S ONE THE BUSINESS.</p>

<p>3589
02:31:56,674 –&gt; 02:31:58,442
I’VE HAD THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE</p>

<p>3590
02:31:58,008 –&gt; 02:32:01,044
THAT.</p>

<p>3591
02:31:58,509 –&gt; 02:32:02,179
EQUALLY OVER THE YEARS THAT</p>

<p>3592
02:32:01,111 –&gt; 02:32:04,582
RELATIONSHIP HAS JUST BUILT AND</p>

<p>3593
02:32:02,246 –&gt; 02:32:07,918
BECOME GREATER AND GREATER AND</p>

<p>3594
02:32:04,648 –&gt; 02:32:09,219
AS AJIT TOUCHED ON, I HAVE MORE</p>

<p>3595
02:32:07,985 –&gt; 02:32:10,888
RESPECT FOR HIM BOTH PERSONALLY</p>

<p>3596
02:32:09,286 –&gt; 02:32:12,322
AND PROFESSIONALLY.</p>

<p>3597
02:32:10,955 –&gt; 02:32:13,990
EVEN THOUGH THE INTERACTION MAY</p>

<p>3598
02:32:12,389 –&gt; 02:32:16,059
BE DIFFERENT THAN SAY HOW WARREN</p>

<p>3599
02:32:14,057 –&gt; 02:32:19,830
AND CHARLIE DO IT, AS AJIT</p>

<p>3600
02:32:16,126 –&gt; 02:32:20,664
TOUCHED ON, THERE IS A REGULAR</p>

<p>3601
02:32:19,897 –&gt; 02:32:22,465
DIALOGUE BOTH AROUND</p>

<p>3602
02:32:20,731 –&gt; 02:32:28,338
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR TWO</p>

<p>3603
02:32:22,532 –&gt; 02:32:29,907
BUSINESSES AND UNITS, BOTH IF WE</p>

<p>3604
02:32:28,405 –&gt; 02:32:31,408
SEE INDIVIDUAL SHOOTS THERE.</p>

<p>3605
02:32:29,974 –&gt; 02:32:32,809
WE MAKE SURE WE’RE ALWAYS</p>

<p>3606
02:32:31,474 –&gt; 02:32:34,144
FOLLOWING UP WITH EACH OTHER BUT</p>

<p>3607
02:32:32,876 –&gt; 02:32:36,780
IT GOES BEYOND THAT.</p>

<p>3608
02:32:34,211 –&gt; 02:32:38,215
AJIT HAS A GREAT UNDERSTANDING</p>

<p>3609
02:32:36,847 –&gt; 02:32:39,750
OF THE BERKSHIRE CULTURE.</p>

<p>3610
02:32:38,282 –&gt; 02:32:41,752
I STRONGLY BELIEVE I DO, TOO.</p>

<p>3611
02:32:39,817 –&gt; 02:32:45,255
ANY TIME WE SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL</p>

<p>3612
02:32:41,819 –&gt; 02:32:46,256
IN ONE OF OUR BUSINESSES, IT’S</p>

<p>3613
02:32:45,322 –&gt; 02:32:47,724
AJIT WHO I’M GOING TO CALL AND</p>

<p>3614
02:32:46,323 –&gt; 02:32:51,995
SAY ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THAT</p>

<p>3615
02:32:47,791 –&gt; 02:32:54,931
WE’RE TAKING THIS APPROACH?</p>

<p>3616
02:32:52,062 –&gt; 02:32:55,933
IS IT CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU</p>

<p>3617
02:32:54,998 –&gt; 02:32:57,601
THINK ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>3618
02:32:55,999 –&gt; 02:32:59,035
IT GOES BEYOND DISCUSSING THE</p>

<p>3619
02:32:57,668 –&gt; 02:33:00,804
BUSINESSES BUT THAT MAINTAINING</p>

<p>3620
02:32:59,102 –&gt; 02:33:02,806
THE EXCEPTIONAL CULTURE WE HAVE</p>

<p>3621
02:33:00,871 –&gt; 02:33:03,006
AT BERKSHIRE AND BUILDING UPON</p>

<p>3622
02:33:02,873 –&gt; 02:33:06,443
THAT.</p>

<p>3623
02:33:03,073 –&gt; 02:33:08,511
VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AJIT AS A</p>

<p>3624
02:33:06,509 –&gt; 02:33:11,782
COLLEAGUE AND IMMENSELY ENJOY</p>

<p>3625
02:33:08,578 –&gt; 02:33:12,349
WORKING WITH HIM EVERY DAY.</p>

<p>3626

WE SHOULD.</p>

<p>3661
02:34:24,388 –&gt; 02:34:29,660

PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE AGING</p>

CULTURE.</p>

<p>3670
02:34:44,408 –&gt; 02:34:47,444
I ASSUME THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT</p>

<p>3671
02:34:47,077 –&gt; 02:34:49,913
CHARLIE.</p>

<p>3672
02:34:47,511 –&gt; 02:34:51,682
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IN</p>

<p>3674
02:34:51,749 –&gt; 02:34:59,656
AGING AT 1% A YEAR AND HE IS</p>

<p>3675

THEY’RE AGING AT 4% A YEAR.</p>

<p>3680
02:35:05,529 –&gt; 02:35:10,600
WE WILL HAVE THE SLOWEST AGING</p>

<p>3682

RECENT YEARS IN TERMS OF</p>

<p>3690

MATCHING RATE TO RISK.</p>

<p>3691

THAT’S WHAT INSURANCE IS ALL</p>

<p>3692
02:35:31,054 –&gt; 02:35:35,926
ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS.</p>

<p>3693
02:35:33,957 –&gt; 02:35:38,061
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT RATE.</p>

<p>3694
02:35:35,993 –&gt; 02:35:39,162
IF YOU THINK 90-YEAR-OLDS AND</p>

20-YEAR-OLDS HAVE AN EQUAL</p>

<p>3699
02:35:44,134 –&gt; 02:35:47,871
YOU WILL GET ALL OF THE</p>

<p>3700

<p>3703

<p>3707

SO THE COMPANIES THAT DO THE</p>

<p>3708
02:36:05,121 –&gt; 02:36:10,393

02:36:28,045 –&gt; 02:36:35,218
VERY INTERESTING BUSINESS.</p>

<p>3718
02:36:30,914 –&gt; 02:36:39,790
BOTH PROGRESSIVE AND GEICO WERE</p>

<p>3719
02:36:35,285 –&gt; 02:36:41,524
STARTED IN THE 30s.</p>

<p>3720
02:36:39,857 –&gt; 02:36:43,459
WE HAVE HAD THE BETTER PRODUCT</p>

<p>3721
02:36:41,591 –&gt; 02:36:47,798
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME IN TERMS</p>

<p>3722
02:36:43,526 –&gt; 02:36:52,869
OF COST AND HERE WE ARE 85 YEARS</p>

<p>3723
02:36:47,865 –&gt; 02:36:57,540
LATER IN OUR CASE AND WE HAVE</p>

<p>3724
02:36:52,936 –&gt; 02:36:59,876
ABOUT 13% OR SO IN THE MARKET,</p>

<p>3725
02:36:57,607 –&gt; 02:37:00,143
THE TWO ARE AT 25% IN THE</p>

<p>3726
02:36:59,943 –&gt; 02:37:01,879
MARKET.</p>

<p>3727
02:37:00,210 –&gt; 02:37:04,280
THE HUGE MARKET AFTER 87 YEARS</p>

<p>3728
02:37:01,945 –&gt; 02:37:06,115
OF HAVING A BETTER PRODUCT, SO</p>

<p>3729
02:37:04,347 –&gt; 02:37:07,150
IT’S A VERY SLOW CHANGING</p>

<p>3730
02:37:06,182 –&gt; 02:37:08,985
COMPETITIVE SITUATION BUT</p>

<p>3731
02:37:07,217 –&gt; 02:37:10,420
PROGRESSIVE HAS DONE A VERY,</p>

<p>3732
02:37:09,052 –&gt; 02:37:13,990
VERY GOOD JOB RECENTLY.</p>

<p>3733
02:37:10,487 –&gt; 02:37:17,761
WE’VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OVER</p>

<p>3734
02:37:14,057 –&gt; 02:37:19,696
THE YEARS.</p>

<p>3735
02:37:17,828 –&gt; 02:37:22,199
WE HAVE MADE SOME ARE VERY</p>

<p>3736
02:37:19,763 –&gt; 02:37:23,633
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.</p>

<p>3737
02:37:22,266 –&gt; 02:37:24,568
OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE FIRST</p>

<p>3738
02:37:23,700 –&gt; 02:37:26,536
QUARTER WAS GOOD.</p>

<p>3739
02:37:24,635 –&gt; 02:37:30,907
BUT WE GAVE BACK MORE MONEY</p>

<p>3740
02:37:26,603 –&gt; 02:37:33,776
UNDER OUR GIVEBACK ARRANGEMENT</p>

<p>3741
02:37:30,974 –&gt; 02:37:35,812

<p>3742

BILLION ON THE GIVEBACK PROGRAM</p>

<p>3743
02:37:35,879 –&gt; 02:37:37,981
THAT WAS LARGER THAN ANY COMPANY</p>

<p>3744
02:37:37,381 –&gt; 02:37:39,716
AS WELL.</p>

<p>3745
02:37:38,048 –&gt; 02:37:43,186
ONE OF THE LARGEST, I THINK, IN</p>

<p>3746
02:37:39,783 –&gt; 02:37:46,022
THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>3747
02:37:43,253 –&gt; 02:37:47,324
AND GEICO AND PROGRESSIVE ARE</p>

<p>3748
02:37:46,089 –&gt; 02:37:48,558
BOTH GOING TO DO VERY WELL IN</p>

<p>3749
02:37:47,390 –&gt; 02:37:50,827
THE FUTURE.</p>

<p>3750
02:37:48,625 –&gt; 02:37:52,562
UNION PACIFIC AND BNSF ARE GOING</p>

<p>3751
02:37:50,894 –&gt; 02:37:54,297
TO DO WELL IN THE FUTURE.</p>

<p>3752
02:37:52,629 –&gt; 02:37:55,632
IN EACH CASE WE WANT TO DO</p>

<p>3753
02:37:54,364 –&gt; 02:37:56,266

HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK GEICO</p>

<p>3763
02:38:09,913 –&gt; 02:38:13,416
IS CATCHING UP WITH PROGRESSIVE.</p>

<p>3764
02:38:11,515 –&gt; 02:38:15,986
MORE THAN A YEAR AGO – ABOUT A</p>

<p>3765
02:38:13,483 –&gt; 02:38:18,889
YEAR AGO PROGRESSIVE HAD MARGINS</p>

<p>3766
02:38:16,053 –&gt; 02:38:24,561
ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS GEICO.</p>

<p>3767
02:38:18,956 –&gt; 02:38:25,295
GROWTH RATES TWICE AS MUCH AS</p>

<p>3768
02:38:24,628 –&gt; 02:38:27,297
GEICOS.</p>

<p>3769
02:38:25,362 –&gt; 02:38:28,498
IF YOU LOOK AT IT NOW,</p>

<p>3770
02:38:27,364 –&gt; 02:38:29,633
PROGRESSIVE IS CRUSHING IT IN</p>

<p>3771
02:38:28,565 –&gt; 02:38:31,267
TERMS OF GROWTH.</p>

<p>3772
02:38:29,700 –&gt; 02:38:34,104
GEICO HAS CAUGHT UP WITH</p>

<p>3773
02:38:31,334 –&gt; 02:38:38,575
PROGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF MARGIN.</p>

<p>3774

<p>3868
02:42:31,641 –&gt; 02:42:35,145
THE CAR, YOU KNOW, AND REALLY</p>

<p>3869
02:42:33,843 –&gt; 02:42:36,112
MAKE THE CHOICE FOR THE NEXT</p>

<p>3870
02:42:35,211 –&gt; 02:42:38,114
FIVE YEARS.</p>

<p>3871
02:42:36,179 –&gt; 02:42:40,316
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY DO?</p>

<p>3872
02:42:38,181 –&gt; 02:42:47,023
BUT IT IS – AND WE GOT A CHANCE</p>

<p>3873
02:42:40,383 –&gt; 02:42:49,726
TO BUY IT AND I SOLD SOME STOCK</p>

<p>3874
02:42:47,089 –&gt; 02:42:50,860
LAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH OUR</p>

<p>3875
02:42:49,793 –&gt; 02:42:52,996
SHAREHOLDERS HAD THEIR</p>

<p>3876
02:42:50,927 –&gt; 02:42:53,930
PERCENTAGE GO UP BECAUSE WE</p>

<p>3877
02:42:53,063 –&gt; 02:42:56,599
REPURCHASED SHARE.</p>

<p>3878
02:42:53,997 –&gt; 02:43:00,303
BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE.</p>

<p>3879
02:42:56,666 –&gt; 02:43:02,839
IN FACT, CHARLIE IN HIS USUAL</p>

<p>3880
02:43:00,370 –&gt; 02:43:05,241
LOW-KEY WAY LET ME KNOW THAT HE</p>

<p>3881
02:43:02,905 –&gt; 02:43:06,709
THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE, TOO,</p>

<p>3882
02:43:05,308 –&gt; 02:43:07,477
DIDN’T YOU CHARLIE?</p>

<p>3883
02:43:06,776 –&gt; 02:43:09,679</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>YES.</p>

<p>3884
02:43:07,544 –&gt; 02:43:11,982</p>

  </blockquote>

<p>3885
02:43:09,746 –&gt; 02:43:14,884
THINGS THAT I CAN GET AWAY WITH</p>

<p>3886
02:43:12,048 –&gt; 02:43:19,556
CHARLIE AND I KIND OF USED THEM</p>

<p>3887
02:43:14,951 –&gt; 02:43:22,459
UP BETWEEN COSTCO AND APPLE.</p>

<p>3888
02:43:19,623 –&gt; 02:43:25,128
SO – AND VERY LIKELY WAS RIGHT</p>

<p>3889
02:43:22,525 –&gt; 02:43:28,331
IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>

<p>3890
02:43:25,195 –&gt; 02:43:35,738
IT’S AN EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS.</p>

<p>3891
02:43:28,398 –&gt; 02:43:40,376
BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT</p>

<p>3892
02:43:35,805 –&gt; 02:43:43,046
IN ITS OWN WAY, IT’S A DIFFERENT</p>

<p>3893
02:43:40,443 –&gt; 02:43:45,015
WAY, BUT TEN FOCUS – WE SEE A</p>

<p>3894
02:43:43,112 –&gt; 02:43:47,050
LOT OF MANAGERS OF A LOT OF</p>

<p>3895
02:43:45,081 –&gt; 02:43:49,485
BUSINESSES AND YOU’RE LOOKING AT</p>

<p>3896
02:43:47,117 –&gt; 02:43:49,853
TWO GREAT ONES ON BOTH ENDS</p>

<p>3897
02:43:49,552 –&gt; 02:43:53,056
HERE.</p>

<p>3898
02:43:49,920 –&gt; 02:43:53,990
HE’S HANDLED THAT BUSINESS SO</p>

<p>3899
02:43:53,123 –&gt; 02:43:55,558
WELL.</p>

<p>3900
02:43:54,057 –&gt; 02:44:01,598
HE COULDN’T DO WHAT STEVE JOBS</p>

<p>3901
02:43:55,625 –&gt; 02:44:01,898
OBVIOUSLY COULD DO IN TERMS OF</p>

<p>3902
02:44:01,665 –&gt; 02:44:04,067
CREATION.</p>

<p>3903
02:44:01,965 –&gt; 02:44:06,069
BUT I DON’T – BUT STEVE JOBS</p>

<p>3904
02:44:04,134 –&gt; 02:44:09,472
COULDN’T REALLY, I DON’T THINK,</p>

<p>3905
02:44:06,135 –&gt; 02:44:10,173
DO WHAT TIM COOK WAS DONE IN</p>

<p>3906
02:44:09,538 –&gt; 02:44:12,876
MANY RESPECTS.</p>

<p>3907

THAT LIST YOU SHOWED OF THE</p>

AMERICAN COMPANIES, IT’S BEEN</p>

<p>3910
02:44:18,682 –&gt; 02:44:23,086
VERY IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA THAT</p>

<p>3911
02:44:19,949 –&gt; 02:44:25,488
WE’VE DONE SO WELL IN THIS NEW</p>

<p>3912
02:44:23,153 –&gt; 02:44:28,725
TECH FIELD AND I PERSONALLY</p>

<p>3913
02:44:25,555 –&gt; 02:44:30,326

REASONINGS.</p>

<p>3917
02:44:35,298 –&gt; 02:44:38,868
I DON’T THINK THEY’RE DOING A</p>

<p>3918
02:44:37,066 –&gt; 02:44:39,736
LOT OF HARM, ANYWAY, A</p>

<p>3919
02:44:38,935 –&gt; 02:44:41,571
COMPETITIVE ONE.</p>

<p>3920
02:44:39,803 –&gt; 02:44:43,873
I THINK THERE’S A CREDIT TO</p>

<p>3921
02:44:41,638 –&gt; 02:44:44,207
AMERICANS, CREDIT TO OUR</p>

<p>3922
02:44:43,940 –&gt; 02:44:45,008
CIVILIZATION.</p>

<p>3923
02:44:44,273 –&gt; 02:44:46,609
AND THEY’RE HUGE.</p>

<p>3924
02:44:45,075 –&gt; 02:44:50,346
AND THEY’RE HUGE, AND THAT’S</p>

<p>3925
02:44:46,675 –&gt; 02:44:53,983
GOOD FOR US.</p>

HOW DO YOU ASSESS IF THESE HIGH</p>

GIVING 40-SOME BILLION TO THE</p>

BILLION, WHATEVER THE AMOUNT</p>

<p>3981

<p>3983

AT ZERO AND JANET YELLEN HAS</p>

TALKED A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT</p>

THE REDUCED CARRYING COST OF THE</p>

<p>3987
02:47:41,351 –&gt; 02:47:48,324
I THINK IN THE LAST FISCAL</p>

<p>3988
02:47:44,654 –&gt; 02:47:49,826
QUARTER, U.S. TREASURY, WHICH</p>

U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH HOLDS A</p>

<p>3990
02:47:49,892 –&gt; 02:47:54,263
FEW BILLION – A FEW TRILLION</p>

<p>3991
02:47:52,861 –&gt; 02:47:56,666
DOLLARS THAN A YEAR AGO.</p>

<p>3992
02:47:54,330 –&gt; 02:47:59,802
THE EXPENSE WAS DOWN 8%, SO YOU</p>

<p>3993

GROUP, THE SHORT-TERM TREASURY</p>

<p>3996
02:48:05,975 –&gt; 02:48:10,313
BILL, AND THAT IS THE YARD STICK</p>

<p>3997
02:48:08,478 –&gt; 02:48:10,580
AGAINST WHICH OTHER VALUES ARE</p>

<p>3998
02:48:10,380 –&gt; 02:48:15,718
MEASURED.</p>

<p>3999
02:48:10,647 –&gt; 02:48:19,322
I MEAN, IF I COULD REDUCE</p>

<p>4000
02:48:15,785 –&gt; 02:48:22,658
GRAVITY, IGRAVITY’S PULL BY ABOT</p>

80%, I’D BE IN THE TOKYO</p>

OLYMPICS JUMPING.</p>

<p>4003
02:48:24,794 –&gt; 02:48:29,966
ESSENTIALLY IF INTEREST RATES</p>

<p>4004
02:48:27,497 –&gt; 02:48:31,968
WERE 10% VALUATIONS, THIS</p>

<p>4005
02:48:30,032 –&gt; 02:48:35,872
INCREDIBLE CHANGE IN THE</p>

<p>4006
02:48:32,034 –&gt; 02:48:39,108
VALUATION OF EVERYTHING THAT</p>

<p>4007
02:48:35,938 –&gt; 02:48:41,310
PRODUCES MONEY, BECAUSE THE RISK</p>

<p>4008
02:48:39,175 –&gt; 02:48:41,543
FREE RATE PRODUCES REALLY SHORT</p>

<p>4009
02:48:41,377 –&gt; 02:48:43,079
ENOUGH.</p>

<p>4010
02:48:41,610 –&gt; 02:48:44,113
RIGHT NOW, NOTHING.</p>

<p>4011
02:48:43,146 –&gt; 02:48:48,184
VERY INTERESTING.</p>

<p>4012
02:48:44,180 –&gt; 02:48:52,655
I BROUGHT THIS BOOK ALONG,</p>

<p>4013
02:48:48,250 –&gt; 02:48:56,392
BECAUSE FOR 25 OR MORE YEARS,</p>

<p>4014
02:48:52,721 –&gt; 02:48:57,627
PAUL SANDALSON’S BOOK WAS THE</p>

DEFINITIVE BOOK ON ECONOMICS.</p>

<p>4016
02:48:57,694 –&gt; 02:49:02,231
IT’S TAUGHT IN EVERY SCHOOL.</p>

<p>4017
02:48:59,862 –&gt; 02:49:07,103
AND PAUL WAS THE FIRST – HE WAS</p>

<p>4018
02:49:02,298 –&gt; 02:49:09,138
THE FIRST NOBEL PRIZE WINNER.</p>

<p>4019
02:49:07,170 –&gt; 02:49:11,774
IT’S SORTS OF A COUSIN TO THE</p>

<p>4020
02:49:09,204 –&gt; 02:49:13,075
NOBEL PRICE.</p>

<p>4021
02:49:11,841 –&gt; 02:49:15,411
THEY STARTED GIVING IT TO</p>

<p>4022
02:49:13,142 –&gt; 02:49:17,480
ECONOMICS IN THE EARLY 60s.</p>

<p>4023
02:49:15,478 –&gt; 02:49:19,349
PAUL SAMUELSSON.</p>

<p>4024
02:49:17,547 –&gt; 02:49:20,917
AMAZINGLY ENOUGH, THE SECOND</p>

<p>4025
02:49:19,415 –&gt; 02:49:25,021
WINNER THAT IS KEN ARROW AND</p>

<p>4026
02:49:20,983 –&gt; 02:49:26,322
BOTH OF THEM ARE THE UNCLES OF</p>

<p>4027
02:49:25,088 –&gt; 02:49:29,091
LARRY SOMERS.</p>

<p>4028
02:49:26,389 –&gt; 02:49:31,093
HE HAS THE FIRST TWO AS UNCLES.</p>

<p>4029
02:49:29,158 –&gt; 02:49:34,163
PAUL WAS A WONDERFUL GUY, A</p>

<p>4030
02:49:31,160 –&gt; 02:49:40,236
WONDERFUL WRITER, THE DEFINITIVE</p>

<p>4031
02:49:34,230 –&gt; 02:49:43,172
WRITER, AND SO I GOT OUT TO ‘73</p>

<p>4032
02:49:40,302 –&gt; 02:49:45,241
ECONOMICS BOOK AND BEAR IN MIND</p>

<p>4033
02:49:43,238 –&gt; 02:49:46,742
ECONOMICS STARTED AS KIND OF AN</p>

<p>4034
02:49:45,308 –&gt; 02:49:49,145
INTERESTING SCIENCE.</p>

<p>4035
02:49:46,809 –&gt; 02:49:51,847
ADAM SMITH WROTE THE WEALTH OF</p>

<p>4036
02:49:49,212 –&gt; 02:49:54,651
NATIONS IN 1776, SOME BOOKS, BUT</p>

<p>4037
02:49:51,914 –&gt; 02:49:57,787
SORT OF DATE IT FROM KIND OF</p>

<p>4038
02:49:54,717 –&gt; 02:50:00,489
WHAT OUR COUNTRY STARTED AND YOU</p>

<p>4039
02:49:57,853 –&gt; 02:50:02,791
HAVE ALL THESE GREAT ECONOMISTS.</p>

<p>4040
02:50:00,556 –&gt; 02:50:04,727
I LOOKED UP IN THE BACK UNDER</p>

<p>4041
02:50:02,858 –&gt; 02:50:05,962
INTEREST RATES, I LOOKED FOR</p>

<p>4042
02:50:04,793 –&gt; 02:50:07,463
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.</p>

<p>4043
02:50:06,029 –&gt; 02:50:12,201
THERE’S NOTHING THERE.</p>

<p>4044
02:50:07,530 –&gt; 02:50:15,104
SO I FINALLY FOUND ZERO INTEREST</p>

<p>4045
02:50:12,268 –&gt; 02:50:17,607
RATES AND PAUL SAMUELSSON,</p>

<p>4046
02:50:15,170 –&gt; 02:50:19,642
BRILLIANT MAN, AFTER A COUPLE</p>

<p>4047
02:50:17,674 –&gt; 02:50:22,979
HUNDRED YEARS WE’VE HAD OF</p>

<p>4048
02:50:19,708 –&gt; 02:50:27,850
STUDYING ECONOMICS, BASICALLY,</p>

<p>4049
02:50:23,046 –&gt; 02:50:29,485
HE SAID THAT – HE SAID YOU CAN</p>

<p>4050
02:50:27,917 –&gt; 02:50:31,587
CONCEIVABLY, TECHNICALLY, YOU</p>

<p>4051
02:50:29,552 –&gt; 02:50:34,023
CAN COP SIEVE PERHAPS OF</p>

<p>4052
02:50:31,653 –&gt; 02:50:36,459
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, BUT IT</p>

<p>4053
02:50:34,090 –&gt; 02:50:39,262
CAN’T EVER REALLY HAPPEN.</p>

<p>4054
02:50:36,526 –&gt; 02:50:41,631
AND THAT WAS IN THE 1970s.</p>

<p>4055
02:50:39,329 –&gt; 02:50:43,866
THIS WASN’T IN DARK AGES.</p>

<p>4056
02:50:41,698 –&gt; 02:50:45,334
NO ECONOMIST ROLLED UP AND SAID</p>

<p>4057
02:50:43,932 –&gt; 02:50:47,637
THIS IS A TERRIBLE LINE.</p>

<p>4058
02:50:45,401 –&gt; 02:50:49,672
AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS WORLD</p>

<p>4059
02:50:47,703 –&gt; 02:50:52,074
WHERE WE HAD ZERO INTEREST RATES</p>

<p>4060
02:50:49,739 –&gt; 02:50:58,214
LAST YEAR – I MEAN LAST WEEK –</p>

<p>4061
02:50:52,141 –&gt; 02:50:59,982
OR THIS WEEK OUT OF FOUR WEEK</p>

<p>4062
02:50:58,281 –&gt; 02:51:01,517
NOTE, AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY</p>

<p>4063
02:51:00,049 –&gt; 02:51:03,786
WHICH HAS MORE THAN THIS BUT</p>

<p>4064
02:51:01,583 –&gt; 02:51:05,721
LET’S SAY WE HAD A HUNDRED</p>

<p>4065
02:51:03,853 –&gt; 02:51:07,857
BILLION IN TREASURY BILLS.</p>

<p>4066
02:51:05,788 –&gt; 02:51:10,760
WE HAVE MORE THAN THAT.</p>

<p>4067
02:51:07,924 –&gt; 02:51:12,495
BEFORE THE EPIDEMIC – PANDEMIC,</p>

<p>4068
02:51:10,827 –&gt; 02:51:15,464
WE WERE GETTING ABOUT A BILLION</p>

<p>4069
02:51:12,561 –&gt; 02:51:18,067
AND A HALF FROM THAT A YEAR.</p>

<p>4070
02:51:15,531 –&gt; 02:51:21,771
AT PRESENT RATES, IF IT’S TWO</p>

<p>4071
02:51:18,134 –&gt; 02:51:22,471
BASIS POINTS, WE’D GET 20</p>

<p>4072
02:51:21,838 –&gt; 02:51:24,774
MILLION.</p>

<p>4073
02:51:22,538 –&gt; 02:51:29,211
IMAGINE YOUR WAGES GOING FROM</p>

<p>4074
02:51:24,841 –&gt; 02:51:31,714
$15 TO $1.20 AN HOUR.</p>

<p>4075
02:51:29,278 –&gt; 02:51:33,416
IT’S BEEN A SEA CHANGE.</p>

<p>4076
02:51:31,781 –&gt; 02:51:35,084
IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE THAT.</p>

<p>4077
02:51:33,483 –&gt; 02:51:35,584
THAT’S WHY THE FED MOVED THE WAY</p>

<p>4078
02:51:35,151 –&gt; 02:51:39,555
THEY DID.</p>

<p>4079
02:51:35,651 –&gt; 02:51:43,359
THEY WANTED TO GIVE A MASSIVE</p>

<p>4080
02:51:39,622 –&gt; 02:51:43,626
PUSH LIKE MARIO DRAGGY DID IN</p>

<p>4081
02:51:43,426 –&gt; 02:51:45,761
EUROPE.</p>

<p>4082
02:51:43,693 –&gt; 02:51:49,131
HE SPED WHATEVER IT TAKES AND</p>

<p>4083
02:51:45,828 –&gt; 02:51:51,734
THEY WENT TO NEGATIVE RATES, AND</p>

<p>4084
02:51:49,198 –&gt; 02:51:56,872
WE – FAIR TOO SAY DIDN’T WANT</p>

<p>4085
02:51:51,800 –&gt; 02:51:59,475
TO GO TO NEGATIVE RATES.</p>

<p>4086
02:51:56,939 –&gt; 02:52:01,477
BUT IF PRESENT RATES WERE</p>

<p>4087
02:51:59,541 –&gt; 02:52:03,179
DESTINED TO BE APPROPRIATE,</p>

<p>4088
02:52:01,544 –&gt; 02:52:07,850
TEN-YEAR SHOULD REALLY BE AT THE</p>

<p>4089
02:52:03,246 –&gt; 02:52:10,753
PRICE IT IS, THOSE COMPANIES</p>

<p>4090
02:52:07,916 –&gt; 02:52:12,054
THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THIS</p>

<p>4091
02:52:10,820 –&gt; 02:52:15,257
QUESTION, THEY’RE – THEY HAVE</p>

<p>4092
02:52:12,120 –&gt; 02:52:18,327
THE ABILITY TO DELIVER CASH AT A</p>

<p>4093
02:52:15,324 –&gt; 02:52:21,564
RATE THAT’S IF YOU DISCOUNT IT</p>

<p>4094
02:52:18,394 –&gt; 02:52:22,198
BACK AND YOU’RE DISCOUNTING AT</p>

<p>4095
02:52:21,631 –&gt; 02:52:23,432
PRESENT INTEREST RATES, STOCKS</p>

<p>4096
02:52:22,265 –&gt; 02:52:25,501
ARE VERY, VERY CHEAP.</p>

<p>4097
02:52:23,499 –&gt; 02:52:27,036
NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT</p>

<p>4098
02:52:25,568 –&gt; 02:52:28,871
INTEREST RATES DO OVER TIME.</p>

<p>4099
02:52:27,103 –&gt; 02:52:31,207
BUT THERE’S A VIEW OF WHAT THE</p>

<p>4100
02:52:28,937 –&gt; 02:52:33,576
RATES WILL BE BASED ON YIELD OUT</p>

<p>4101
02:52:31,274 –&gt; 02:52:36,212
30 YEARS AND SO ON.</p>

<p>4102
02:52:33,643 –&gt; 02:52:38,247
IT’S A FASCINATING TIME.</p>

<p>4103
02:52:36,279 –&gt; 02:52:40,149
WE’VE NEVER REALLY SEEN WHAT</p>

<p>4104
02:52:38,313 –&gt; 02:52:44,787
SHOVELING MONEY IN ON THE BASIS</p>

<p>4105
02:52:40,216 –&gt; 02:52:46,922
THAT WE’RE DOING IT ON A FISCAL</p>

<p>4106
02:52:44,853 –&gt; 02:52:49,792
BASIS WHILE FOLLOWING A MONETARY</p>

<p>4107
02:52:46,989 –&gt; 02:52:51,761
POLICY IN THE CLOSE ZERO</p>

<p>4108
02:52:49,858 –&gt; 02:52:52,495
INTEREST RATES AND IT IS</p>

<p>4109
02:52:51,828 –&gt; 02:52:54,764
ENORMOUSLY PLEASANT.</p>

<p>4110
02:52:52,562 –&gt; 02:52:55,398
BUT IN ECONOMICS THERE’S ONE</p>

<p>4111
02:52:54,831 –&gt; 02:52:56,999
THING ALWAYS.</p>

<p>4112
02:52:55,465 –&gt; 02:52:59,502
YOU CAN NEVER DO ONE THING.</p>

<p>4113
02:52:57,066 –&gt; 02:52:59,702
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY AND THEN</p>

<p>4114
02:52:59,569 –&gt; 02:53:08,911
WHAT.</p>

<p>4115
02:52:59,769 –&gt; 02:53:13,082
AND WE’RE SENDING OUT HUGE SUMS,</p>

<p>4116
02:53:08,978 –&gt; 02:53:15,351
I MEAN, PRESIDENT SEND ON 85%</p>

<p>4117
02:53:13,148 –&gt; 02:53:17,553
ARE GOING TO GET A CHECK.</p>

<p>4118
02:53:15,418 –&gt; 02:53:20,022
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE WERE</p>

<p>4119
02:53:17,620 –&gt; 02:53:22,558
SAYING 40% COULD NEVER COME UP</p>

<p>4120
02:53:20,089 –&gt; 02:53:24,727
WITH $400 OF CASH.</p>

<p>4121
02:53:22,625 –&gt; 02:53:27,897
WE’VE GOT 85% OF THE PEOPLE</p>

<p>4122
02:53:24,793 –&gt; 02:53:28,831
GETTING THOSE SUMS AND SO FAR</p>

<p>4123
02:53:27,964 –&gt; 02:53:29,932
WE’VE HAD NO PLEASANT</p>

<p>4124
02:53:28,898 –&gt; 02:53:33,736
CONSEQUENCES ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>4125
02:53:29,999 –&gt; 02:53:37,507
PEOPLE WHO GET THE MONEY FEEL</p>

<p>4126
02:53:33,803 –&gt; 02:53:39,742
BETTER AND PEOPLE WHO ARE</p>

<p>4127
02:53:37,573 –&gt; 02:53:42,111
LENDING MONEY DOESN’T.</p>

<p>4128
02:53:39,809 –&gt; 02:53:44,046
IT CAUSES AN ELECTRIC TO BE</p>

<p>4129
02:53:42,177 –&gt; 02:53:45,214
HAPPY AND WE’LL SEE IF IT CAUSES</p>

<p>4130
02:53:44,113 –&gt; 02:53:47,283
ANYTHING ELSE.</p>

<p>4131
02:53:45,281 –&gt; 02:53:48,718
AND IF IT DOESN’T CAUSE ANYTHING</p>

<p>4132
02:53:47,350 –&gt; 02:53:51,153
ELSE, YOU CAN COUNT ON IT</p>

<p>4133
02:53:48,784 –&gt; 02:53:52,588
CONTINUING IN A VERY BIG WAY.</p>

<p>4134
02:53:51,220 –&gt; 02:53:55,624
BUT THERE ARE CONSEQENCES TO</p>

<p>4135
02:53:52,654 –&gt; 02:53:59,762
EVERYTHING IN ECONOMICS.</p>

<p>4136
02:53:55,691 –&gt; 02:54:02,231
THAT IS – THAT IS WHY THE</p>

<p>4137
02:53:59,829 –&gt; 02:54:04,300
APPLES WHEN WE OPEN MICROSOFT,</p>

<p>4138
02:54:02,297 –&gt; 02:54:06,135
BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLE</p>

<p>4139
02:54:04,367 –&gt; 02:54:06,368
COMPANIES IN WHAT THEY EARN ON</p>

<p>4140
02:54:06,202 –&gt; 02:54:08,337
CAPITAL.</p>

<p>4141
02:54:06,435 –&gt; 02:54:11,006
THEY DON’T REQUIRE A LOT OF</p>

<p>4142
02:54:08,404 –&gt; 02:54:13,909
CAPITAL AND THEY GUSH OUT MORE</p>

<p>4143
02:54:11,073 –&gt; 02:54:16,111
MONEY, AND IF YOU’RE TRYING TO</p>

<p>4144
02:54:13,976 –&gt; 02:54:17,780
POINT BONDS THAT GUSH OUT MORE</p>

<p>4145
02:54:16,178 –&gt; 02:54:20,749
MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL</p>

<p>4146
02:54:17,847 –&gt; 02:54:21,016
GOVERNMENT, WE GOT A HUNDRED</p>

<p>4147
02:54:20,816 –&gt; 02:54:23,486
BILLION.</p>

<p>4148
02:54:21,083 –&gt; 02:54:26,489
LIKE 30 OR $40 MILLION A YEAR,</p>

<p>4149
02:54:23,553 –&gt; 02:54:28,257
WHATEVER IT MAY BE, DEPENDING ON</p>

<p>4150
02:54:26,556 –&gt; 02:54:30,793
THE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE.</p>

<p>4151
02:54:28,324 –&gt; 02:54:32,261
WHICH PUT THE PRESSURE ON, WHICH</p>

<p>4152
02:54:30,860 –&gt; 02:54:32,561
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE AUTHORITIES</p>

<p>4153
02:54:32,328 –&gt; 02:54:34,530
WANT.</p>

<p>4154
02:54:32,628 –&gt; 02:54:36,299
I MEAN, THAT’S – THEY ARE</p>

<p>4155
02:54:34,597 –&gt; 02:54:38,334
PUSHING THE ECONOMY IN A – AND</p>

<p>4156
02:54:36,365 –&gt; 02:54:40,636
THEY’RE DOING IT IN EUROPE, EVEN</p>

<p>4157
02:54:38,401 –&gt; 02:54:44,306
MORE EXTREME, AND THEY’RE</p>

<p>4158
02:54:40,702 –&gt; 02:54:46,742
PUSHING IT AND WE’RE AIDING IT</p>

<p>4159
02:54:44,373 –&gt; 02:54:48,410
WITH FISCAL POLICY.</p>

<p>4160
02:54:46,809 –&gt; 02:54:49,512
PEOPLE HAVE BECOME NUMB TO</p>

<p>4161
02:54:48,477 –&gt; 02:54:53,682
NUMBERS.</p>

<p>4162
02:54:49,579 –&gt; 02:54:54,283
TRILLIONS DON’T MEAN ANYTHING TO</p>

<p>4163
02:54:53,749 –&gt; 02:54:56,919
ANYBODY.</p>

<p>4164
02:54:54,350 –&gt; 02:54:57,219
AND $1400 DOES MEAN SOMETHING TO</p>

<p>4165
02:54:56,986 –&gt; 02:54:59,155
THEM.</p>

<p>4166
02:54:57,286 –&gt; 02:55:01,390
WE’LL SEE WHERE IT ALL LEADS,</p>

<p>4167
02:54:59,221 –&gt; 02:55:03,492
BUT CHARLIE AND I CONSIDER THE</p>

<p>4168
02:55:01,456 –&gt; 02:55:05,694
MOST INTERESTING MOVIE BY FAR</p>

<p>4169
02:55:03,559 –&gt; 02:55:06,061
WE’VE EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF</p>

<p>4170
02:55:05,761 –&gt; 02:55:09,198
ECONOMICS.</p>

<p>4171
02:55:06,128 –&gt; 02:55:10,900</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>YES, AND THE PROFESSIONAL</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>4172
02:55:09,265 –&gt; 02:55:11,700

OF GOOD THINGS.</p>

<p>4326
03:00:46,835 –&gt; 03:00:51,874
IT MAKES IT REAL MONEY IF THEY</p>

<p>4327
03:00:48,437 –&gt; 03:00:55,777
CAN GET THE GAMBLERS TO COME IN.</p>

<p>4328
03:00:51,941 –&gt; 03:00:56,278
THEY’RE WILLING TO TAKE MORE</p>

<p>4329
03:00:55,844 –&gt; 03:01:00,849
ACTION.</p>

<p>4330
03:00:56,345 –&gt; 03:01:03,686
YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE, HUGE</p>

<p>4331
03:01:00,916 –&gt; 03:01:05,554
ASSET TO HUMANITY BUT IT REALLY</p>

<p>4332
03:01:03,752 –&gt; 03:01:06,622
MAKES US MONEY WHEN PEOPLE ARE</p>

<p>4333
03:01:05,620 –&gt; 03:01:08,924
DOING STUPID THINGS.</p>

<p>4334
03:01:06,689 –&gt; 03:01:09,157
THAT’S WHERE THE MONEY REALLY</p>

<p>4335
03:01:08,991 –&gt; 03:01:12,194
IS.</p>

<p>4336
03:01:09,224 –&gt; 03:01:14,563

<p>4337

<p>4338
03:01:14,629 –&gt; 03:01:21,637
HE WROTE IT IN 1936.</p>

<p>4339
03:01:19,435 –&gt; 03:01:23,572
SPECULATORS, MANY DO NO HARM AS</p>

<p>4340

BUBBLES ON THE STEADY STREAM OF</p>

<p>4341
03:01:23,638 –&gt; 03:01:28,510
ENTERPRISE BUT THE POSITION IS</p>

<p>4342
03:01:26,174 –&gt; 03:01:29,912
SERIOUS WHEN ENTERPRISE BECOMES</p>

<p>4343
03:01:28,576 –&gt; 03:01:31,346
THE BUBBLE ON SPECULATION.</p>

<p>4344
03:01:29,979 –&gt; 03:01:32,514
WHEN THE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT OF</p>

<p>4345
03:01:31,413 –&gt; 03:01:35,717
THE COUNTRY BECOMES A BYPRODUCT</p>

<p>4346

OF THE TIFS OF A CASINO, THE JOB</p>

<p>4347
03:01:35,784 –&gt; 03:01:42,658
IS LIKELY TO BE ILL DONE.</p>

<p>4348
03:01:40,389 –&gt; 03:01:44,359
WE’VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE</p>

<p>4349
03:01:42,725 –&gt; 03:01:46,428
CASINO, THE LAST YEAR.</p>

<p>4350
03:01:44,426 –&gt; 03:01:48,063
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE</p>

<p>4351
03:01:46,494 –&gt; 03:01:51,233
HAVE SET UP ACCOUNTS WHERE</p>

<p>4352
03:01:48,129 –&gt; 03:01:52,935
THEY’RE DAY TRADING, PUTS AND</p>

<p>4353
03:01:51,300 –&gt; 03:01:54,903
CALLS, AND I’D SAY YOU HAVE THE</p>

<p>4354

GREATEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER</p>

<p>4355
03:01:54,970 –&gt; 03:01:58,741
OF GAMBLERS, ESSENTIALLY,</p>

<p>4356
03:01:56,805 –&gt; 03:02:00,876
THAT – AND THERE’S NOTHING</p>

<p>4357
03:01:58,807 –&gt; 03:02:02,711
WRONG WITH GAMBLING.</p>

<p>4358
03:02:00,943 –&gt; 03:02:04,980
THEY GOT BETTER ODDS THAN THEY</p>

<p>4359
03:02:02,778 –&gt; 03:02:06,648
PLAY THE STATE LOTTERY, BUT</p>

<p>4360
03:02:05,047 –&gt; 03:02:06,949
THEY’VE HAD CASH IN THEIR</p>

<p>4361

POCKET.</p>

<p>4362
03:02:07,016 –&gt; 03:02:10,419
THEY’VE HAD ACTION, AND THEY</p>

<p>4363
03:02:08,650 –&gt; 03:02:13,756
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD</p>

<p>4364
03:02:10,485 –&gt; 03:02:15,958
RESULTS AND IF THEY JUST BOUGHT</p>

<p>4365
03:02:13,822 –&gt; 03:02:19,461
STOCKS THEY’D DO FINE, AND HELD</p>

<p>4366
03:02:16,025 –&gt; 03:02:21,029
THEM, BUT THE GAMBLING IMPULSES</p>

<p>4367
03:02:19,527 –&gt; 03:02:22,664
IN VERY STRONG IN PEOPLE</p>

<p>4368
03:02:21,096 –&gt; 03:02:25,567
WORLDWIDE AND OCCASIONALLY IT</p>

<p>4369
03:02:22,731 –&gt; 03:02:30,305
GETS AN ENORMOUS SHOVE AND</p>

<p>4370
03:02:25,633 –&gt; 03:02:32,374
CONDITIONS LEAD TO THIS WHERE</p>

<p>4371
03:02:30,372 –&gt; 03:02:33,976
MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING.</p>

<p>4372
03:02:32,441 –&gt; 03:02:36,945
THEY’RE LEAVING EVERY DAY AND</p>

<p>4373
03:02:34,042 –&gt; 03:02:38,847
THAT CREATES ITS OWN RAEMT FOR A</p>

<p>4374
03:02:37,012 –&gt; 03:02:43,252
WHILE AND NOBODY TELLS YOU WHEN</p>

<p>4375
03:02:38,914 –&gt; 03:02:47,889
THE CLOCK IS GOING TO STRIKE</p>

<p>4376
03:02:43,318 –&gt; 03:02:48,657
MIDNIGHT AND IT ALL TURNS INTO</p>

<p>4377
03:02:47,956 –&gt; 03:02:50,659
PUMPKINS.</p>

<p>4378
03:02:48,724 –&gt; 03:02:52,995

<p>4379
03:02:50,725 –&gt; 03:02:53,962
WITH OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY OR</p>

<p>4380
03:02:53,061 –&gt; 03:02:57,866
WHETHER THEY’RE – AND IF</p>

<p>4381
03:02:54,028 –&gt; 03:02:58,567
THEY’RE PLAYING TOOLISHLY WITH</p>

<p>4382
03:02:57,933 –&gt; 03:03:00,402
THEIR OWN MONEY BUT THE BIG</p>

<p>4383

<p>4384

PEOPLE’S MONEY.</p>

<p>4385
03:03:01,236 –&gt; 03:03:05,040
THEY’RE GOING TO BEAT US.</p>

<p>4386
03:03:03,272 –&gt; 03:03:06,508
WE’RE NOT – WE’RE NOT – THAT’S</p>

<p>4387

A DIFFERENT GAME AND THEY’VE</p>

MONEY, SO WE’RE NOT GOING TO</p>

HAVE MUCH LUCK ON ACQUISITIONS</p>

<p>4391
03:03:12,981 –&gt; 03:03:17,886
WHILE IS THIS SORT OF A PERIOD</p>

<p>4392
03:03:16,418 –&gt; 03:03:18,186
CONTINUES, BUT IT’S HAPPENED</p>

<p>4393
03:03:17,953 –&gt; 03:03:20,955
BEFORE.</p>

<p>4394
03:03:18,253 –&gt; 03:03:27,829
THIS IS ABOUT AS EXTREME AS</p>

<p>4395

WE’VE SEEN ITS, HASN’T, CHARLIE?</p>

<p>4396
03:03:28,129 –&gt; 03:03:31,533
I CALL IT FEE DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>4397
03:03:29,665 –&gt; 03:03:34,069
THE ADVISOR GETS A FEE, AND OF</p>

<p>4398
03:03:31,600 –&gt; 03:03:36,671
COURSE, THE MORE THAT YOU GET,</p>

<p>4399
03:03:34,135 –&gt; 03:03:38,406
THE SILLIER YOUR CIVILIZATION IS</p>

<p>4400
03:03:36,738 –&gt; 03:03:41,276
GETTING, AND TO SOME EXTENT IT’S</p>

<p>4401
03:03:38,473 –&gt; 03:03:43,211
A MORAL FAILING, TOO.</p>

<p>4402
03:03:41,343 –&gt; 03:03:47,382
BECAUSE THE EASY MONEY MADE BY</p>

<p>4403
03:03:43,278 –&gt; 03:03:49,317
THINGS LIKE SPACS AND RETURN</p>

<p>4404
03:03:47,448 –&gt; 03:03:52,888
DERIVATIVES AND SO ON AND SO ON.</p>

<p>4405
03:03:49,384 –&gt; 03:03:54,456
YOU PUSH THAT TO EXCESS, IT</p>

<p>4406
03:03:52,954 –&gt; 03:03:55,691
CAUSES HORRIBLE PROBLEMS IN</p>

<p>4407
03:03:54,523 –&gt; 03:03:57,025
CIVILIZATION AND REFLECTS NO</p>

<p>4408
03:03:55,757 –&gt; 03:03:59,628
CREDIT ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE</p>

<p>4409
03:03:57,092 –&gt; 03:04:01,463
DOING IT AND NO CREDIT ON THE</p>

<p>4410
03:03:59,694 –&gt; 03:04:04,199
PEOPLE – THE REGULATORS.</p>

<p>4411
03:04:01,530 –&gt; 03:04:05,634
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO BE</p>

<p>4414
03:04:06,135 –&gt; 03:04:10,372
BUT IT’S WHERE THE MONEY IS.</p>

<p>4415
03:04:07,803 –&gt; 03:04:12,340
IT’S SHAMEFUL WHAT’S GOING ON.</p>

<p>4416

IT’S NOT JUST STUPID, IT’S</p>

<p>4417

SHAMEFUL.</p>

<p>4418

IT’S NOT – I DON’T REGARD IT AS</p>

<p>4419

A SHAMEFUL ON A LOT – THE</p>

PEOPLE THAT GAMBLE.</p>

<p>4421
03:04:22,017 –&gt; 03:04:26,321
I MEAN – GAMBLING IS A HUMAN</p>

<p>4422
03:04:25,420 –&gt; 03:04:28,557
INSTINCT AND THEY’VE GOT MONEY</p>

I DON’T LIKE THE PROFESSIONALS</p>

<p>4428

GOING TO BE A LOT LESS.</p>

<p>4550

YOU’RE REPURCHASING STOCK</p>

<p>4635

<p>4642
03:12:43,485 –&gt; 03:12:47,655
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF BERKSHIRE</p>

<p>4643
03:12:46,087 –&gt; 03:12:49,324

<p>4647
03:12:53,895 –&gt; 03:12:56,631
DIVIDENDS WOULD BE FAR MORE</p>

TAXED ADVANTAGE FOR SHARE OLDERS</p>

<p>4649

HAVE A VOTE BY SHAREHOLDERS.</p>

<p>4653
03:13:08,476 –&gt; 03:13:11,613
WE HAVE DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDERS</p>

<p>4654

THAN A REIT HAVE.</p>

<p>4655

GOES UP NEXT WEEK, BASICALLY.</p>

<p>4658
03:13:18,787 –&gt; 03:13:23,558
AND WE’VE GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE</p>

<p>4659
03:13:21,723 –&gt; 03:13:23,758
WHO WERE ASSEMBLED OVER 55</p>

<p>4660

YEARS.</p>

<p>4661

PEOPLE THAT IT WAS A LIFETIME</p>

<p>4663

TO CASH OUT, THEY THOUGHT THEY’D</p>

<p>4665
03:13:32,400 –&gt; 03:13:36,271
GET A FAIR PRICE AT THAT TIME.</p>

<p>4666
03:13:34,202 –&gt; 03:13:38,205
BUT THEY BOUGHT IT WITH NO</p>

<p>4667
03:13:36,337 –&gt; 03:13:41,376
INTENTIONS LIKE THAT, SO WE HAD</p>

<p>4668
03:13:38,272 –&gt; 03:13:42,944
A VOTE AND I FEEL SOMETHING LIKE</p>

<p>4674
03:13:48,149 –&gt; 03:13:52,020
YOU’D BE CRAZY TO PAY A REGULAR</p>

<p>4682

<p>4684
03:14:10,171 –&gt; 03:14:13,174
CHANGE INTO COCA-COLA.</p>

<p>4685
03:14:11,372 –&gt; 03:14:15,443
PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE EVERY DAY</p>

<p>4686
03:14:13,241 –&gt; 03:14:16,811
WHICH DO YOU WANT – SORT OF</p>

THING YOU WANT TO BE IN.</p>

<p>4688

NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DECISION,</p>

<p>4693

WE’VE GOT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL</p>

NEVERTHELESS, SO WHAT?</p>

<p>4931
03:23:14,949 –&gt; 03:23:20,254
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT</p>

<p>4932
03:23:17,118 –&gt; 03:23:21,622
USED TO ACCOMPLISH THE MOST FOR</p>

<p>4933
03:23:20,321 –&gt; 03:23:25,459
HUMANITY.</p>

<p>4934
03:23:21,689 –&gt; 03:23:27,761
AND THAT MEANS HAVING SMART</p>

<p>4935
03:23:25,526 –&gt; 03:23:31,932
PEOPLE PROPERLY MOTIVATED AND</p>

<p>4936
03:23:27,828 –&gt; 03:23:33,033
MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IMPROPERLY</p>

<p>4937
03:23:31,999 –&gt; 03:23:35,136
MOTIVATED, DISTRIBUTE IT IN A</p>

<p>4938
03:23:33,100 –&gt; 03:23:38,372
WAY AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL</p>

<p>4939
03:23:35,202 –&gt; 03:23:38,973
IT WOULD BE 10, 20, 30, 40 YEARS</p>

FROM NOW.</p>

<p>4941
03:23:39,040 –&gt; 03:23:41,976
I KNOW IF IT GOES TO THE</p>

<p>4942
03:23:40,540 –&gt; 03:23:43,477
GOVERNMENT IT REDUCES THE</p>

<p>4943
03:23:42,043 –&gt; 03:23:45,613
NATIONAL DEBT BY THAT AMOUNT.</p>

<p>4944
03:23:43,544 –&gt; 03:23:47,614
I DON’T THINK IT CHANGES WHETHER</p>

<p>4945
03:23:45,680 –&gt; 03:23:48,649
THEY CHANGE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS OR</p>

<p>4946
03:23:47,681 –&gt; 03:23:50,951
ANYTHING ELSE.</p>

<p>4947
03:23:48,716 –&gt; 03:23:53,220
I JUST THINK THAT LITTLE FIGURE</p>

<p>4948
03:23:51,018 –&gt; 03:23:56,190

03:25:17,238 –&gt; 03:25:21,609
OF CORRELATING THE KISK RISK AND</p>

<p>4990

<p>5045

TOO BIG.</p>

<p>5047
03:27:47,921 –&gt; 03:27:51,258
THE NUKE RISK, FOR EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>5048
03:27:49,657 –&gt; 03:27:53,260
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS VERY</p>

<p>5049

<p>5052
03:27:58,732 –&gt; 03:28:01,735

<p>5053

03:40:42,062 –&gt; 03:40:45,998
SO YOU REALLY GET JUST THROUGH</p>

<p>5385
03:40:45,331 –&gt; 03:40:48,167
NATURAL FORCES YOU GET MORE OF</p>

<p>5386
03:40:46,065 –&gt; 03:40:50,370
YOUR MONEY IN THINGS THAT HAVE</p>

<p>5387
03:40:48,234 –&gt; 03:40:51,404
DEVELOPED MORE FAVORABLY THAN</p>

<p>5388
03:40:50,437 –&gt; 03:40:53,572
YOU THOUGHT.</p>

<p>5389
03:40:51,471 –&gt; 03:40:54,840

AS CHARLIE WOULD SAY, IT’S NOT</p>

<p>5393

<p>5394

THE BAD ONES CAUSE YOU MORE</p>

<p>5395

PROBLEMS.</p>

<p>5396
03:41:05,685 –&gt; 03:41:10,656
BUT IN THE CHILDREN OF</p>

<p>5397

BUSINESSES, THE SMALL ONES KIND</p>

<p>5398

BUSINESSES, CHARLIE AND I, AND</p>

<p>5400
03:41:16,729 –&gt; 03:41:20,400
BERKSHIRE WAS TEXTILES, AND</p>

<p>5401
03:41:19,298 –&gt; 03:41:21,934
DEPARTMENT STORE AND TRADING</p>

<p>5402
03:41:20,467 –&gt; 03:41:23,469
STAMPS, BLUE CHIPS BUSINESS, AND</p>

<p>5403
03:41:22,001 –&gt; 03:41:25,037
THOSE WERE THE THREE COMPANIES</p>

<p>5404
03:41:23,536 –&gt; 03:41:26,539
WE PUT TOGETHER, AND ALL THREE</p>

<p>5405
03:41:25,104 –&gt; 03:41:30,143
OF THE ORIGINAL BUSINESSES</p>

<p>5406

<p>5411
03:41:38,218 –&gt; 03:41:42,322
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT.</p>

<p>5412
03:41:39,686 –&gt; 03:41:43,856
THAT DOESN’T MEAN WE’RE GOING TO</p>

<p>5413
03:41:42,388 –&gt; 03:41:45,057
BE PHASED OUT OVER TIME.</p>

<p>5414

EVERY BUSINESS HAS A LOT TO</p>

<p>5415

THINK ABOUT THAT WAY.</p>

<p>5416

THE BIGGEST DANGER, THEY HAVE</p>

<p>5417

THAT SECTION IN THE PERSPECTIVES</p>

03:42:00,039 –&gt; 03:42:02,408
THAT THIS BUSINESS GETS THE</p>

DOING, BUT THEY LIKE TO PUT ON</p>

<p>5432

THAT’S THE SINGLE BIGGEST</p>

03:42:18,558 –&gt; 03:42:21,194
DANGER.</p>

<p>5434
03:42:18,791 –&gt; 03:42:24,397
THEN THAT PERSON STAYS AND RUNS</p>

<p>5435
03:42:21,261 –&gt; 03:42:26,399
IT AND STAYS IN THE TEXTILE OR</p>

DEPARTMENT STORE BUSINESS.</p>

<p>5437

AND IT EXPANDS.</p>

<p>5438
03:42:27,634 –&gt; 03:42:32,338
I LOOKED AT A LOT OF BUSINESSES.</p>

<p>5439

THAT’S WHAT’S CAUSED THE NUMBER</p>

THE TRUTH IS, I’M GOING DODGE</p>

<p>5457

<p>5537
03:46:04,116 –&gt; 03:46:06,386
EXPECTED.</p>

<p>5538
03:46:04,484 –&gt; 03:46:10,690
AND THEN WHEN IT DID PERFORM IT</p>

<p>5539
03:46:06,452 –&gt; 03:46:12,658
WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.</p>

<p>5540
03:46:10,757 –&gt; 03:46:15,728
THEY INCURRED BILLIONS AND</p>

<p>5541
03:46:12,725 –&gt; 03:46:19,766
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ENERGY</p>

<p>5542
03:46:15,795 –&gt; 03:46:21,734
COSTS VERSUS A MULTIPLE OF</p>

<p>5543
03:46:19,832 –&gt; 03:46:22,001
BASICALLY TEN TIMES WHAT THEY</p>

<p>5544
03:46:21,801 –&gt; 03:46:24,637
PAID.</p>

<p>5545
03:46:22,068 –&gt; 03:46:26,972
THEY PAID TEN TIMES IN ENERGY</p>

<p>5546
03:46:24,704 –&gt; 03:46:29,075
COSTS OVER THOSE FOUR DAYS WHAT</p>

<p>5547
03:46:27,039 –&gt; 03:46:32,111
THEY PAID IN THE PAST YEAR.</p>

<p>5548
03:46:29,142 –&gt; 03:46:32,545
SO A VERY SUBSTANTIAL EVENT FOR</p>

<p>5549
03:46:32,177 –&gt; 03:46:34,180
TEXAS.</p>

<p>5550
03:46:32,612 –&gt; 03:46:36,882
WE’VE GONE TO TEXAS WITH WHAT WE</p>

<p>5551
03:46:34,247 –&gt; 03:46:38,550
BELIEVE IS A GOOD SOLUTION.</p>

<p>5552
03:46:36,949 –&gt; 03:46:42,321
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME PULLING</p>

<p>5553
03:46:38,617 –&gt; 03:46:44,490
IT TOGETHER, UNDERSTANDING THE</p>

<p>5554
03:46:42,388 –&gt; 03:46:48,561
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AROUND IT.</p>

<p>5555
03:46:44,557 –&gt; 03:46:49,195
AND OUR PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE</p>

<p>5556
03:46:48,628 –&gt; 03:46:53,198
FACT THAT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE</p>

<p>5557
03:46:49,262 –&gt; 03:46:57,036
OF TEXANS WERE AT RISK, AND WE</p>

<p>5558
03:46:53,265 –&gt; 03:46:58,437
NEEDED TO HAVE EFFECTIVELY AN</p>

<p>5559
03:46:57,103 –&gt; 03:46:58,637
INSURANCE POLICY IN PLACE FOR</p>

<p>5560
03:46:58,504 –&gt; 03:47:00,439
THEM.</p>

<p>5561
03:46:58,704 –&gt; 03:47:02,408
THAT IF THEY NEEDED TO POWER ON</p>

<p>5562
03:47:00,506 –&gt; 03:47:04,644
SHORT NOTICE, IT WOULD BE ABLE</p>

<p>5563
03:47:02,475 –&gt; 03:47:07,046
TO BE DISPATCHED AND IT WOULD BE</p>

<p>5564
03:47:04,711 –&gt; 03:47:10,616
THERE FOR THE FOUR DAYS WE’RE</p>

<p>5565
03:47:07,113 –&gt; 03:47:11,183
PROPOSING IT COULD BE THERE FOR</p>

<p>5566
03:47:10,683 –&gt; 03:47:14,486
SEVEN DAYS.</p>

<p>5567
03:47:11,250 –&gt; 03:47:15,755
AND THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF</p>

<p>5568
03:47:14,553 –&gt; 03:47:17,590
OUR PROPOSAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN, IF</p>

<p>5569
03:47:15,822 –&gt; 03:47:18,724
THERE’S A BETTER PROPOSAL THAT’S</p>

<p>5570
03:47:17,657 –&gt; 03:47:20,759
BROUGHT FORWARD, WE’VE</p>

<p>5571
03:47:18,791 –&gt; 03:47:21,460
ACCOMPLISHED OUR MISSION.</p>

<p>5572
03:47:20,826 –&gt; 03:47:26,365
WE’VE JUST REALLY BEEN THERE</p>

<p>5573
03:47:21,527 –&gt; 03:47:26,999
TO – IT’S THE BEST PROPOSAL OR</p>

<p>5574
03:47:26,432 –&gt; 03:47:28,700
OPTION WE COULD COME UP WITH,</p>

<p>5575
03:47:27,066 –&gt; 03:47:30,235
AND OBVIOUSLY WITH TEXAS OR ELON</p>

<p>5576
03:47:28,767 –&gt; 03:47:32,204
OR SOMEBODY COMES UP WITH A</p>

<p>5577
03:47:30,302 –&gt; 03:47:35,374
BETTER PROPOSITION, WE’VE ALWAYS</p>

<p>5578
03:47:32,271 –&gt; 03:47:35,775
SAID, TEXAS, YOU SHOULD PURSUE</p>

<p>5579
03:47:35,441 –&gt; 03:47:37,343
IT.</p>

<p>5580
03:47:35,842 –&gt; 03:47:40,746
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE</p>

<p>5581
03:47:37,409 –&gt; 03:47:41,613
HAVE WHAT REMAINS IS A VERY GOOD</p>

<p>5582
03:47:40,812 –&gt; 03:47:44,083
PROPOSAL FOR TEXAS, AND IT WILL</p>

<p>5583
03:47:41,680 –&gt; 03:47:44,550
CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AND</p>

<p>5584
03:47:44,150 –&gt; 03:47:46,585
EVALUATED.</p>

<p>5585
03:47:44,617 –&gt; 03:47:49,321
THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A</p>

<p>5586
03:47:46,652 –&gt; 03:47:53,859
BATTERY PROPOSAL AND OUR</p>

<p>5587
03:47:49,388 –&gt; 03:47:56,195
PROPOSAL IS THAT WE WILL HAVE</p>

<p>5588
03:47:53,926 –&gt; 03:47:56,696
POWER THAT CAN BE GENERATED</p>

<p>5589
03:47:56,262 –&gt; 03:47:57,697
CONTINUOUSLY FOR SEVEN</p>

<p>5590
03:47:56,762 –&gt; 03:48:01,033
CONSISTENT DAYS.</p>

<p>5591
03:47:57,764 –&gt; 03:48:01,667
WHERE IF YOU WENT TO A BATTERY</p>

<p>5592
03:48:01,100 –&gt; 03:48:04,904
SOLUTION, YOU MAY RELEASE THAT</p>

<p>5593
03:48:01,734 –&gt; 03:48:05,804
POWER THAT’S BEEN STORED FOR</p>

<p>5594
03:48:04,971 –&gt; 03:48:07,372
FOUR HOURS, WITH YOU WE’RE</p>

<p>5595
03:48:05,871 –&gt; 03:48:08,841
TALKING FOUR DAYS OF A PROBLEM,</p>

<p>5596
03:48:07,439 –&gt; 03:48:10,676
NOT FOUR HOURS.</p>

<p>5597
03:48:08,908 –&gt; 03:48:13,212
AND IT’S JUST A COMPLETELY</p>

<p>5598
03:48:10,743 –&gt; 03:48:13,546
DIFFERENT COST EQUATION AND</p>

<p>5599
03:48:13,279 –&gt; 03:48:15,914
SOLUTION.</p>

<p>5600
03:48:13,613 –&gt; 03:48:17,750
SO VERY PROUD THAT OUR TEAM’S</p>

<p>5601
03:48:15,981 –&gt; 03:48:19,585
BROUGHT FORWARD WHAT I THOUGHT</p>

<p>5602
03:48:17,817 –&gt; 03:48:25,224
WAS A VERY UNIQUE SOLUTION.</p>

<p>5603
03:48:19,652 –&gt; 03:48:26,192
WE WORKED HARD WITH OUR SU</p>

<p>5604
03:48:25,291 –&gt; 03:48:28,394
SUPPLIERS AND PUT TOGETHER WHAT</p>

<p>5605
03:48:26,259 –&gt; 03:48:30,529
WE BELIEVE IS A FIRM COST THAT</p>

<p>5606
03:48:28,461 –&gt; 03:48:32,031
CAN ALSO BE DELIVERED BY</p>

<p>5607
03:48:30,596 –&gt; 03:48:35,367
NOVEMBER OF ‘23.</p>

<p>5608
03:48:32,098 –&gt; 03:48:35,567
SO AGAIN WE PUT A FIRM DATE ON</p>

<p>5609
03:48:35,434 –&gt; 03:48:39,271
IT.</p>

<p>5610
03:48:35,634 –&gt; 03:48:39,605
IT WON’T BE READY NEXT WINTER,</p>

<p>5611
03:48:39,338 –&gt; 03:48:41,039
UNFORTUNATELY.</p>

<p>5612
03:48:39,671 –&gt; 03:48:42,675
WON’T BE READY THIS SUMMER BUT</p>

<p>5613
03:48:41,106 –&gt; 03:48:45,945
IT’S A VALUABLE SOLUTION AND ONE</p>

<p>5614
03:48:42,742 –&gt; 03:48:46,945
THAT WE HOPE AT LEAST LEADS TO</p>

<p>5615
03:48:46,011 –&gt; 03:48:47,780
THE RIGHT DISCUSSION AND THE</p>

<p>5616
03:48:47,012 –&gt; 03:48:48,380
RIGHT LONG-TERM DISCUSSION FOR</p>

<p>5617
03:48:47,847 –&gt; 03:48:49,582
THE STATE.</p>

<p>5618
03:48:48,447 –&gt; 03:48:52,484</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>YEAH, AND WE’RE ALSO WILLING</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>5619
03:48:49,648 –&gt; 03:48:55,020
TO PUT UP $4 BILLION THAT IF WE</p>

<p>5620
03:48:52,551 –&gt; 03:48:57,289
DON’T DELIVER WHEN WE SAY WE’RE</p>

<p>5621
03:48:55,087 –&gt; 03:49:02,628
GOING TO DELIVER, WE’LL PAY IT</p>

<p>5622
03:48:57,356 –&gt; 03:49:05,430
AS A PENALTY, BASICALLY.</p>

<p>5623
03:49:02,695 –&gt; 03:49:07,333
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO</p>

<p>5624
03:49:05,497 –&gt; 03:49:10,803
GENERAL ELECTRIC, SAID, HOW LONG</p>

<p>5625
03:49:07,400 –&gt; 03:49:12,971
COULD WE GET TURBINES.</p>

<p>5626
03:49:10,870 –&gt; 03:49:16,342
YOU KNOW, IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE</p>

<p>5627
03:49:13,038 –&gt; 03:49:18,811
PREPARED FOR 2023, YOU HAVE TO</p>

<p>5628
03:49:16,409 –&gt; 03:49:22,882
START AT A POINT FAIRLY SOON,</p>

<p>5629
03:49:18,878 –&gt; 03:49:25,317
AND YOU HAVE INFLATION GOING ON,</p>

<p>5630
03:49:22,949 –&gt; 03:49:27,052
AND KEY WAS NOT GOING THE CHANGE</p>

<p>5631
03:49:25,384 –&gt; 03:49:28,720
THINGS IN A MONTH.</p>

<p>5632
03:49:27,119 –&gt; 03:49:29,721
THEY HAD 100 PEOPLE WORKING ON</p>

<p>5633
03:49:28,787 –&gt; 03:49:31,490
IT OR SOMETHING.</p>

<p>5634
03:49:29,788 –&gt; 03:49:32,358</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>YEAH, THEY HAD HUNDREDS</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>5635
03:49:31,557 –&gt; 03:49:34,493
WORKING ON IT.</p>

<p>5636
03:49:32,424 –&gt; 03:49:35,727</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>AND GE IS COOPERATIVE.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>5637
03:49:34,560 –&gt; 03:49:37,696
BUT DOESN’T MEAN WE HAVE THE</p>

<p>5638
03:49:35,794 –&gt; 03:49:38,296
BEST SOLUTION.</p>

<p>5639
03:49:37,763 –&gt; 03:49:40,432
WE JUST KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.</p>

<p>5640
03:49:38,363 –&gt; 03:49:42,335
IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT FASTER,</p>

<p>5641
03:49:40,499 –&gt; 03:49:45,037
THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER,</p>

<p>5642
03:49:42,401 –&gt; 03:49:48,006
WHATEVER, THAT’S TERRIFIC.</p>

<p>5643
03:49:45,104 –&gt; 03:49:50,710
BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING</p>

<p>5644
03:49:48,073 –&gt; 03:49:52,912
TO LOSE TIF THEY DON’T DO IT.</p>

<p>5645
03:49:50,776 –&gt; 03:49:54,479
AND WE’LL BACK OUR PROMISE UP BY</p>

<p>5646
03:49:52,979 –&gt; 03:49:57,183
$4 BILLION, AND WE WON’T HAVE</p>

<p>5647
03:49:54,546 –&gt; 03:49:59,385
ANY RINKY DINK CLAUSES IN THERE</p>

<p>5648
03:49:57,249 –&gt; 03:50:00,886
THAT IF THIS HAPPENSER THAT</p>

<p>5649
03:49:59,452 –&gt; 03:50:02,855
HAPPENS, WE WON’T PAYMENT BUT WE</p>

<p>5650
03:50:00,953 –&gt; 03:50:03,455
WON’T BE ABLE TO DO THAT AIER</p>

<p>5651
03:50:02,922 –&gt; 03:50:06,091
FROM NOW.</p>

<p>5652
03:50:03,522 –&gt; 03:50:07,759
WE’LL BE ABLE TO DO IT A YEAR</p>

<p>5653
03:50:06,158 –&gt; 03:50:09,595
FROM NOW WITH THE COSTS WHAT</p>

<p>5654
03:50:07,826 –&gt; 03:50:11,497
THEY ARE THEN.</p>

<p>5655
03:50:09,662 –&gt; 03:50:11,797
TEXAS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE TO DO</p>

<p>5656
03:50:11,563 –&gt; 03:50:14,800
BUSINESS.</p>

<p>5657
03:50:11,864 –&gt; 03:50:18,437
WE DO A LOT OF BUSINESS THERE.</p>

<p>5658
03:50:14,867 –&gt; 03:50:21,340
IT’S A GREAT PLACE.</p>

<p>5659
03:50:18,504 –&gt; 03:50:25,177
AND THIS WAS OUT OF THE BLUE,</p>

<p>5660
03:50:21,407 –&gt; 03:50:28,213
BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER – THE</p>

<p>5661
03:50:25,244 –&gt; 03:50:31,150
NATURE OF UTILITY BUSINESS IS</p>

<p>5662
03:50:28,280 –&gt; 03:50:32,417
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR</p>

<p>5663
03:50:31,217 –&gt; 03:50:33,219
SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY ISN’T</p>

<p>5664
03:50:32,484 –&gt; 03:50:36,822
GOING TO HAPPEN.</p>

<p>5665
03:50:33,286 –&gt; 03:50:38,056
YOU KNOW, YOU DON’T WANT TO SAY,</p>

<p>5666
03:50:36,889 –&gt; 03:50:40,726
IT’S A 1 IN 30 YEAR EVENT AND</p>

<p>5667
03:50:38,123 –&gt; 03:50:42,561
PEOPLE DIE.</p>

<p>5668
03:50:40,793 –&gt; 03:50:45,464
SO, YOU WANT A MARGIN OF SAFETY</p>

<p>5669
03:50:42,628 –&gt; 03:50:47,032
IN IT, AND WE’VE GOT ONE</p>

HAVE OTHER SOLUTIONS, AND WE</p>

YOUR $300,000, $400,000, A YEAR</p>

<p>6143
04:07:26,731 –&gt; 04:07:30,835
AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE KEEPS</p>

PROPOSING YOU GET AN INCREASE</p>

<p>6145
04:07:30,902 –&gt; 04:07:34,372

YOU KNOW, DOING HIS BEST.</p>

<p>6148

IT’S – BUT WE’RE NOT GOING TO</p>

SPEND A LOT OF TIME – WE MAY DO</p>

<p>6150
04:07:44,049 –&gt; 04:07:48,653
IT ON A PERSONAL BASIS, BUT</p>

<p>6151

WE’RE NOT GOING TAKE A LOT OF</p>

<p>6152

PEOPLE – WE WANT THEM TO KNOW</p>

<p>6153

WHAT’S GOING ON WITH BSF AND HOW</p>

KATIE’S DOING AND IF THE CASEY</p>

<p>6156
04:07:57,829 –&gt; 04:08:01,165
AND SO ON.</p>

<p>6157
04:07:58,964 –&gt; 04:08:02,667
WE REALLY DON’T – EXCEPT A</p>

THE DETAILS, BUT KAT AID PACIFIC</p>

<p>6180
04:08:48,913 –&gt; 04:08:53,985
THEY COULDN’T LAND IN HONG KONG</p>

<p>6181
04:08:52,450 –&gt; 04:08:57,355
UNLESS THEY HAD AN INSURANCE</p>

POLICY BY MONDAY OF THE</p>

<p>6183

FOLLOWING WEEK.</p>

<p>6184
04:08:57,789 –&gt; 04:08:59,190
WE CAN DO IT.</p>

<p>6185
04:08:58,123 –&gt; 04:09:00,525
SHE CALLS ME UP.</p>

<p>6186
04:08:59,257 –&gt; 04:09:02,426
HE THINKS OF A PRICE.</p>

<p>6187
04:09:00,592 –&gt; 04:09:06,397
I THINK OF A PRICE.</p>

<p>6188
04:09:02,493 –&gt; 04:09:08,332
BUT WE CAN DO IT.</p>

<p>6189
04:09:06,464 –&gt; 04:09:08,566
WE CAN TAKE THE LOSS IF IT</p>

<p>6190
04:09:08,399 –&gt; 04:09:10,401
HAPPENS.</p>

<p>6191
04:09:08,633 –&gt; 04:09:14,572
THEY CALLED ME IN THE SEARS</p>

<p>6192
04:09:10,468 –&gt; 04:09:17,608
TOWER, I THINK, BACK THEN.</p>

<p>6193
04:09:14,639 –&gt; 04:09:19,510
NOBODY KNEW – THEY DIDN’T KNOW</p>

<p>6194
04:09:17,675 –&gt; 04:09:20,111
WEATHER BOMBS MIGHT BE PLACED</p>

<p>6195
04:09:19,577 –&gt; 04:09:22,747
ALL OVER.</p>

<p>6196
04:09:20,178 –&gt; 04:09:25,984
SO THEY WANTED MORE INSURANCE</p>

<p>6197
04:09:22,814 –&gt; 04:09:27,352
ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WE GAVE THEM</p>

<p>6198
04:09:26,051 –&gt; 04:09:29,720
A PRICE.</p>

<p>6199
04:09:27,419 –&gt; 04:09:30,889
SO THAT SORT OF AN ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p>6200
04:09:29,787 –&gt; 04:09:33,557
HASN’T REALLY PERSISTED.</p>

<p>6201
04:09:30,955 –&gt; 04:09:37,361
THERE WERE TIMES, I THINK,</p>

<p>6202
04:09:33,624 –&gt; 04:09:37,662
PERHAPS AIG, HE WOULD DO THE</p>

<p>6203
04:09:37,428 –&gt; 04:09:39,931
SAME THING.</p>

<p>6204
04:09:37,728 –&gt; 04:09:41,499
BUT THERE WEREN’T 10 OR 20</p>

<p>6205
04:09:39,998 –&gt; 04:09:42,533
PEOPLE, AND THEY NEEDED BIG</p>

<p>6206
04:09:41,566 –&gt; 04:09:44,769
LIMITS IN SOME CASES.</p>

<p>6207
04:09:42,600 –&gt; 04:09:47,171
AND WE WERE GOOD FOR IT.</p>

<p>6208
04:09:44,836 –&gt; 04:09:48,840
AND THEY KNEW IF THEY BOUGHT THE</p>

<p>6209
04:09:47,238 –&gt; 04:09:50,875
INSURANCE AND IT HAPPENED, WE’D</p>

<p>6210
04:09:48,907 –&gt; 04:09:53,511
WRITE A CHECK AND IT WOULD</p>

<p>6211
04:09:50,942 –&gt; 04:09:55,346
CLEAR.</p>

<p>6212
04:09:53,578 –&gt; 04:09:56,647
AJIT, YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.</p>

BECOME A LOT MORE.</p>

<p>6216
04:10:01,786 –&gt; 04:10:04,422
COMPETITIVE.</p>

<p>6217
04:10:02,387 –&gt; 04:10:05,322
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PUT UP</p>

<p>6218
04:10:04,489 –&gt; 04:10:08,693
BIG LIMITS.</p>

<p>6219
04:10:05,389 –&gt; 04:10:11,462
NOT AS MUCH AS WE DO, BUT THEY</p>

<p>6220
04:10:08,760 –&gt; 04:10:11,695
CAN PUT UP $1 BILLION PRETTY</p>

<p>6221
04:10:11,529 –&gt; 04:10:12,296
EASILY.</p>

<p>6222

THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WE</p>

<p>6223
04:10:12,363 –&gt; 04:10:15,533
HAVE, WE STILL HAVE, BUT IT’S NO</p>

LONGER A BIG A DEAL AS IT USED</p>

04:12:43,581 –&gt; 04:12:47,485
CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE</p>

<p>6291
04:12:45,283 –&gt; 04:12:48,852
ANALYST COMMUNITY SOME THEY GO</p>

<p>6292
04:12:47,551 –&gt; 04:12:49,920
ON EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND</p>

<p>6293
04:12:48,919 –&gt; 04:12:51,322
REPEAT CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT</p>

<p>6294
04:12:49,987 –&gt; 04:12:55,292
THEIR COMPANY, AND IT BECOMES</p>

<p>6295
04:12:51,389 –&gt; 04:12:55,559
PART OF – SORT OF THE CAT</p>

<p>6296
04:12:55,359 –&gt; 04:12:56,994
CATECHISM.</p>

<p>6297
04:12:55,626 –&gt; 04:13:00,064
NOBODY’S GOING ON TWO MONTH’S</p>

<p>6298
04:12:57,061 –&gt; 04:13:01,399
THE CEO SAID ONE THING AND SAY,</p>

<p>6299
04:13:00,131 –&gt; 04:13:01,566
THAT ACTUALLY REALLY ISN’T THE</p>

<p>6300
04:13:01,466 –&gt; 04:13:02,767
WAY.</p>

<p>6301
04:13:01,632 –&gt; 04:13:03,267
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE</p>

<p>6302
04:13:02,834 –&gt; 04:13:07,038
COURSE.</p>

<p>6303
04:13:03,334 –&gt; 04:13:08,005
SO IF YOU GET THESE MYTHS, AND</p>

<p>6304
04:13:07,105 –&gt; 04:13:08,706
THEY CAN OCCUR IN A LOT OF</p>

<p>6305
04:13:08,072 –&gt; 04:13:10,608
DIFFERENT WAYS.</p>

<p>6306
04:13:08,773 –&gt; 04:13:12,310
I CAN GIVE A LOT OF EXAMPLES,</p>

<p>6307
04:13:10,675 –&gt; 04:13:15,646
WHICH I WON’T DO.</p>

<p>6308
04:13:12,377 –&gt; 04:13:16,781
WON’T TELL MY FRIENDS IN</p>

<p>6309
04:13:15,713 –&gt; 04:13:17,048
CORPORATE, GOING TO SQUEAL ON</p>

<p>6310
04:13:16,848 –&gt; 04:13:19,283
THEM.</p>

<p>6311
04:13:17,115 –&gt; 04:13:22,620
BUT THERE’S A LOT OF MYTHOLOGY</p>

<p>6312
04:13:19,350 –&gt; 04:13:24,221
THAT GETS HANDED DOWN FROM ONE</p>

<p>6313
04:13:22,687 –&gt; 04:13:26,190
CEO TO THE NEXT, AND THE</p>

<p>6314

04:13:26,257 –&gt; 04:13:31,161
THAT PICKS HIM, YOU KNOW, WAS ON</p>

<p>6316
04:13:29,126 –&gt; 04:13:32,997
THE WRONG COURSE OR HAS BEEN</p>

<p>6317
04:13:31,228 –&gt; 04:13:33,597
TELLING YOU SOMETHING SMG THAT</p>

<p>6318
04:13:33,064 –&gt; 04:13:35,899
ISN’T TRUE.</p>

<p>6319
04:13:33,664 –&gt; 04:13:39,603
THEN HE STARTS REPEATING IT, AND</p>

<p>6320
04:13:35,966 –&gt; 04:13:41,939
IT LEADS TO ENORMOUS ERRORS.</p>

<p>6321
04:13:39,670 –&gt; 04:13:43,541
BUT IT’S HARD TO TELL THE STORY</p>

<p>6322
04:13:42,006 –&gt; 04:13:45,142
WITHOUT GIVING EXAMPLES, AND I</p>

<p>6323
04:13:43,607 –&gt; 04:13:47,445
DON’T LIKE TO GIVE EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>6324
04:13:45,209 –&gt; 04:13:49,647
SO WE’LL SEE WHEN I WRITE ABOUT</p>

<p>6325
04:13:47,511 –&gt; 04:13:51,115
IT SOMETIME.</p>

<p>6326

CHARLIE, YOU’VE PROBABLY GOT</p>

<p>6327
04:13:51,182 –&gt; 04:13:54,618
SOME THOUGHTS.</p>

<p>6328
04:13:51,949 –&gt; 04:13:56,754
HE’S HAD A RINGSIDE SEAT TO A</p>

<p>6338
04:14:11,669 –&gt; 04:14:19,243
SO ONE OF MY FAVORITE REMARKS IN</p>

<p>6339
04:14:15,205 –&gt; 04:14:23,647
THE HISTORY OF HUMAN REMARKS WAS</p>

<p>6340
04:14:19,310 –&gt; 04:14:24,415
BY SIR CEDRIC HARDWICK WHO IS A</p>

<p>6341
04:14:23,714 –&gt; 04:14:27,651
GREAT BRITISH ACTOR.</p>

<p>6342

HE SAID, I HAVE BEEN A GREAT</p>

ACTOR FOR SO LONG THAT I NO</p>

ON ANY SUBJECT, AND I THINK THAT</p>

<p>6346
04:14:33,157 –&gt; 04:14:37,762
HAPPENS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND</p>

<p>6347
04:14:35,259 –&gt; 04:14:38,062
IT HAPPENS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY</p>

LESSER OBJECTIVE, WHICH WAS</p>

<p>6392

PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT TO US</p>

EVEN THAN J.P. MORGAN OR AMAZON,</p>

<p>6394
04:16:06,751 –&gt; 04:16:10,855

SOME BENEFITS IN THE SENSE THAT</p>

<p>6399

AND LIKE I SAY, WE PROBABLY</p>

SAVED MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO</p>

<p>6408

PARTNERS, BECAUSE THEY KNEW</p>

<p>6409

WERE DOING.</p>

<p>6412

INTERESTING.</p>

<p>6419
04:17:07,578 –&gt; 04:17:13,417
THERE’S AN INGENIUS ASPECT TO IT</p>

NAMED – WHICH DOESN’T HAVE ANY</p>

04:17:53,290 –&gt; 04:17:56,026
COST THE COMPANY THAT MUCH, BUT</p>

<p>6441
04:17:54,458 –&gt; 04:17:57,728
YOU DON’T SEE IT.</p>

<p>6442
04:17:56,093 –&gt; 04:17:59,029
SO THE COMPANY PAYS IT, AND MOST</p>

<p>6443
04:17:57,795 –&gt; 04:18:00,965
OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT WAITING</p>

<p>6444
04:17:59,096 –&gt; 04:18:03,066
ROOM SITTING NEXT TO ME, THEY</p>

<p>6445
04:18:01,032 –&gt; 04:18:07,805
ARE NOT SITTING THERE THINKING</p>

<p>6446
04:18:03,133 –&gt; 04:18:08,472
ABOUT WHETHER I CAN AFFORD TO DO</p>

<p>6447
04:18:07,872 –&gt; 04:18:09,640
THIS, YOU KNOW, OR WHAT’S THIS</p>

<p>6448
04:18:08,539 –&gt; 04:18:11,074
GOING TO DO?</p>

<p>6449
04:18:09,707 –&gt; 04:18:13,276
THEY’RE GENERALLY UNDER SOME</p>

<p>6450
04:18:11,141 –&gt; 04:18:14,845
KIND OF A PLAN.</p>

<p>6451
04:18:13,343 –&gt; 04:18:16,513
NOT ALWAYS, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THEY</p>

<p>6452
04:18:14,912 –&gt; 04:18:19,350
DON’T THINK IF THE COMPANY</p>

<p>6453
04:18:16,580 –&gt; 04:18:21,619
WASN’T PAYING THEM THAT THEY</p>

<p>6454
04:18:19,417 –&gt; 04:18:22,553
COULD PAY THAT IN ADDITIONAL</p>

<p>6455
04:18:21,685 –&gt; 04:18:23,520
COMPENSATION.</p>

<p>6456
04:18:22,620 –&gt; 04:18:25,889
BUT OF COURSE THE WEIRD SYSTEM</p>

<p>6457
04:18:23,587 –&gt; 04:18:28,859
IS THE COMPANY GETS A DEDUCTION</p>

<p>6458
04:18:25,956 –&gt; 04:18:29,526
IF THEY PAY IT, BUT IF YOU PAY</p>

<p>6459
04:18:28,926 –&gt; 04:18:31,529
IT YOURSELF ON A POLICY I DON’T</p>

<p>6460
04:18:29,593 –&gt; 04:18:35,466
BELIEVE YOU GET A DEDUCTION.</p>

<p>6461
04:18:31,596 –&gt; 04:18:37,568
SO IT’S SOMETHING THAT’S – MOST</p>

<p>6462
04:18:35,533 –&gt; 04:18:39,303
OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SEEING AS</p>

HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM, SO WE DID</p>

04:19:36,827 –&gt; 04:19:45,869
NOT MAKE INROADS ON THAT, AND WE</p>

04:23:12,175 –&gt; 04:23:14,244
HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN.</p>

<p>6591
04:23:13,677 –&gt; 04:23:15,446
WE WERE HAPPY.</p>

<p>6592
04:23:14,311 –&gt; 04:23:18,181
AND I’D CALL HIM AT THE END OF</p>

<p>6593
04:23:15,512 –&gt; 04:23:21,184
THE YEAR AND SAY, PAUL, THIS</p>

<p>6594
04:23:18,248 –&gt; 04:23:21,919
PLACE IS – YOU’RE SHOOTING THE</p>

<p>6595

LIGHTS OUT.</p>

<p>6596
04:23:21,986 –&gt; 04:23:24,087
YOU SHOULD TAKE A RAISE OR A</p>

<p>6597
04:23:23,954 –&gt; 04:23:25,989
BONUS.</p>

<p>6598
04:23:24,154 –&gt; 04:23:26,657
HE’D SAY, WE’LL TALK ABOUT THAT</p>

<p>6599
04:23:26,056 –&gt; 04:23:27,925
NEXT YEAR.</p>

<p>6600
04:23:26,724 –&gt; 04:23:28,926
HE JUST LOVED THE BUSINESS.</p>

<p>6601
04:23:27,992 –&gt; 04:23:30,694
I LOVED BERKSHIRE.</p>

<p>6602
04:23:28,992 –&gt; 04:23:32,996
HE LOVED THE BUSINESS.</p>

<p>6603
04:23:30,761 –&gt; 04:23:34,397
AND I WASN’T GOING TO ADD</p>

<p>6604
04:23:33,063 –&gt; 04:23:36,633
ANYTHING BY HAVING HIM FILL OUT</p>

<p>6605
04:23:34,464 –&gt; 04:23:39,369
A BUNCH OF REPORTS ABOUT HOW</p>

<p>6606
04:23:36,700 –&gt; 04:23:41,738
MUCH HE’S USING IN THE WAY OF</p>

<p>6607
04:23:39,436 –&gt; 04:23:43,607
CARBON OR THE – YOU KNOW, IT’S</p>

<p>6608
04:23:41,805 –&gt; 04:23:46,076
JUST RIDICULOUS THINK OF A GUY</p>

<p>6609
04:23:43,674 –&gt; 04:23:47,611
LIKE PAUL ANDREWS BEHAVING IN AN</p>

ANTI-SOCIAL MANNER OF ANYTHING</p>

OF THE SORT.</p>

<p>6612
04:23:50,648 –&gt; 04:23:56,520
AND WE’D LOVE TO HAVE MORE OF</p>

<p>6613
04:23:54,785 –&gt; 04:23:57,988
THOSE, AND OBVIOUSLY WE GOT</p>

<p>6614

BIGGER, THEY GET HARDER TO BUY.</p>

<p>6615
04:23:58,055 –&gt; 04:24:01,992

SO GENERALLY TODAY WHAT I FOCUS</p>

<p>6693
04:26:48,024 –&gt; 04:26:50,961
ON WHEN READING IS REALLY AROUND</p>

<p>6694
04:26:49,392 –&gt; 04:26:54,197
OUR BUSINESSES.</p>

<p>6695
04:26:51,028 –&gt; 04:26:56,199

HOW THEY’RE GOING TO GET</p>

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY?</p>

<p>6705
04:27:10,247 –&gt; 04:27:14,117
SO, A LOT OF TIME SPENT ON THAT</p>

<p>6706
04:27:12,883 –&gt; 04:27:16,119
AND AS THAT KNOWLEDGE IS BUILT</p>

<p>6707
04:27:14,184 –&gt; 04:27:17,821
IT’S SHARING IT BACK AND FORTH</p>

IN LOVE WITH YOUR BUSINESS, AND</p>

<p>6731

THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>6732
04:28:07,537 –&gt; 04:28:11,674

<p>6760

OUTSTANDING.</p>

<p>6772

ROBIN HOOD.</p>

<p>6774
04:30:02,419 –&gt; 04:30:05,255

<p>6776

I DON’T THINK YOU’D BUILD A</p>

UP AN EXCHANGE OVER HERE AND</p>

<p>6785
04:30:31,648 –&gt; 04:30:36,686
I’LL TRADE OUR CORN FUTURES AND</p>

<p>6796

OVERALL.</p>

<p>6799
04:31:06,116 –&gt; 04:31:10,954

<p>6803
04:31:15,425 –&gt; 04:31:20,597
BUT THEY ALSO MAKE TERRIFIC</p>

<p>6804

<p>6806
04:31:22,732 –&gt; 04:31:25,601

<p>6891
04:34:37,060 –&gt; 04:34:42,298

<p>6894

BACK TO WORK OR OPERATIONS –</p>

<p>6895

WHEN WE CLOSED THE FURNITURE</p>

<p>6896
04:34:51,174 –&gt; 04:34:54,644
STORES, THEY WERE CLOSED FOR SIX</p>

<p>6897
04:34:52,943 –&gt; 04:34:56,112
WEEKS OR SO ON AVERAGE, AND THEY</p>

<p>6898
04:34:54,711 –&gt; 04:34:58,848
DIDN’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO</p>

<p>6899

<p>6900
04:34:58,915 –&gt; 04:35:01,951
THEY CAN’T STOP PEOPLE FROM</p>

<p>6901
04:35:00,383 –&gt; 04:35:03,386
BUYING THINGS.</p>

<p>6902
04:35:02,018 –&gt; 04:35:05,288
AND WE CAN’T DELIVER THEM.</p>

<p>6903
04:35:03,453 –&gt; 04:35:06,689
THEY SAY, THAT’S OKAY, NOBODY</p>

<p>6904
04:35:05,355 –&gt; 04:35:08,057
ELSE CAN DELIVER THEM EITHER.</p>

<p>6905
04:35:06,756 –&gt; 04:35:09,792
WE WAIT FOR THREE MONTHS.</p>

<p>6906

THE BACKLOG GROWS.</p>

<p>6907
04:35:09,859 –&gt; 04:35:14,597
AND THEN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD END</p>

<p>6908
04:35:11,995 –&gt; 04:35:16,599
WHEN THE $600 PAYMENTED ENDED.</p>

<p>6909

EVERY WEEK I CALL OR HE CALLS ME</p>

<p>6915
04:35:25,475 –&gt; 04:35:29,478
AND WE GO OVER DAY BY DAY WHAT</p>

<p>6916

HAPPENED AT THREE DIFFERENT</p>

KANSAS CITY, AND DALLAS.</p>

<p>6919
04:35:31,915 –&gt; 04:35:35,585
AND IT JUST WON’T STOP.</p>

<p>6920
04:35:33,350 –&gt; 04:35:39,522
PEOPLE HAVE MONEY IN THEIR</p>

<p>6923

A MONTH OR TWO, HOUSE PRICE</p>

<p>6925

<p>6926

ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.</p>

<p>6929
04:35:51,367 –&gt; 04:36:02,978
BUT IT’S ALMOST A BUYING FRIENZ,</p>

<p>6930
04:36:02,445 –&gt; 04:36:03,212
EXCEPT CERTAIN PLACE US CAN’T</p>

<p>6932
04:36:03,279 –&gt; 04:36:04,013
YOU CAN’T BY INTERNATIONAL</p>

TRAVEL.</p>

<p>6934
04:36:04,080 –&gt; 04:36:05,581
SO MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED FROM</p>

<p>6935
04:36:04,780 –&gt; 04:36:08,217

IN THEORY, COMPANIES SHOULD WANT</p>

GOOD PEOPLE AND TREATS THEM</p>

<p>7601
05:01:10,819 –&gt; 05:01:16,658
WELL, THOSE GOOD PEOPLE WILL</p>

<p>7602

<p>7758

<p>7771

ABSOLUTE TROUGH, THE COVID</p>

<p>7773

<p>7781
05:07:33,834 –&gt; 05:07:37,938
THIS YEAR WAS MUCH MORE A</p>

<p>7782

<p>7800
05:08:18,446 –&gt; 05:08:20,881

MEETING, AT LEAST THE S– EVEN</p>

<p>7806

<p>7807
05:08:36,998 –&gt; 05:08:40,100

<p>7808
05:08:37,765 –&gt; 05:08:41,269

<p>7809

WARREN BUFFET BECAUSE IT WAS</p>

<p>7810
05:08:41,335 –&gt; 05:08:46,307
SUCH UNCHARTED TERRITORY.</p>

<p>7811
05:08:43,938 –&gt; 05:08:47,374
REMEMBER HE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE HIS</p>

<p>7812
05:08:46,374 –&gt; 05:08:47,909
HAIRCUT LAST YEAR LIKE THE REST</p>

<p>7814
05:08:47,976 –&gt; 05:08:52,680
BUT YEAH, I WOULD ALSO AGREE</p>

<p>7815
05:08:50,979 –&gt; 05:08:54,849
WITH YOU.</p>

<p>7816
05:08:52,747 –&gt; 05:08:57,018
A LOT OF THINGS CHANGED.</p>

<p>7817
05:08:54,916 –&gt; 05:08:57,285
HE REFERENCED THAT IN THE</p>

<p>7818
05:08:57,085 –&gt; 05:08:59,554

<p>7819

WE WILL GET TO THAT AS YOU JUST</p>

<p>7820
05:08:59,621 –&gt; 05:09:02,055
MENTIONED.</p>

<p>7821
05:09:01,522 –&gt; 05:09:04,826
BUT EVEN IT’S YEAR, TALKING</p>

<p>7822
05:09:02,122 –&gt; 05:09:05,093
ABOUT THE RISE OF THE RETAIL</p>

<p>7824

TALKING ABOUT THE CASINO AND</p>

<p>7827

WARNING ABOUT THAT.</p>

<p>7828

WHILE AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE A</p>

<p>7829
05:09:13,968 –&gt; 05:09:18,305

AND INVEST AND SAVE YOU HAVE TO</p>

<p>7831
05:09:18,372 –&gt; 05:09:22,977
BE VERY CAREFUL, TOO.</p>

<p>7832
05:09:20,408 –&gt; 05:09:25,046
THOSE WERE MY KEY TAKEAWAYS</p>

<p>7833

WHAT DO YOU THINK?</p>

<p>7837

MY FIRST YEAR COVERING THE</p>

EVENT.</p>

<p>7839
05:09:31,686 –&gt; 05:09:34,388
IT’S INTERESTING TO SEE JUST HOW</p>

<p>7840
05:09:33,121 –&gt; 05:09:37,124
BROAD THE QUESTIONS WERE.</p>

<p>7841
05:09:34,455 –&gt; 05:09:40,561
PICKING UP ON YOUR POINT,</p>

<p>7842
05:09:37,191 –&gt; 05:09:41,696
THOUGH, ABOUT WHAT WARREN BUFFET</p>

<p>7843
05:09:40,628 –&gt; 05:09:43,831
SAYS ABOUT THE ROBIN HOOD TRADE,</p>

<p>7844
05:09:41,763 –&gt; 05:09:45,900
WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME IN THESE</p>

<p>7845
05:09:43,898 –&gt; 05:09:47,602
HOURS THAT HE ANSWERED PATIENTLY</p>

<p>7846
05:09:45,967 –&gt; 05:09:49,637
ALL THE QUESTIONS WAS A BIT OF A</p>

<p>7847
05:09:47,669 –&gt; 05:09:50,838
DIVIDE I SAW BETWEEN THE</p>

<p>7848
05:09:49,704 –&gt; 05:09:52,806
SENTIMENT OF THE MARKET IS RIGHT</p>

<p>7849
05:09:50,905 –&gt; 05:09:54,708
NOW, WHERE SOME OF THE</p>

<p>7850
05:09:52,873 –&gt; 05:09:56,510
EXCITEMENT IS VERSUS WHERE BOTH</p>

<p>7851
05:09:54,775 –&gt; 05:09:57,378
WARREN BUFFET AND CHARLIE MUNGER</p>

<p>7852
05:09:56,577 –&gt; 05:10:00,147
SEE THE OPPORTUNITIES.</p>

<p>7853
05:09:57,445 –&gt; 05:10:03,150
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BITCOIN FOR</p>

<p>7854
05:10:00,214 –&gt; 05:10:04,185
EXAMPLE, NO SURPRISE, STRONG</p>

<p>7855
05:10:03,217 –&gt; 05:10:06,320
OPINION THERE FROM CHARLIE</p>

<p>7856
05:10:04,252 –&gt; 05:10:09,724
MUNGER SAYING OF COURSE HE HATES</p>

<p>7857
05:10:06,387 –&gt; 05:10:12,259
THE BITCOIN SUCCESS, AND HE</p>

<p>7858
05:10:09,790 –&gt; 05:10:13,394
THINKS THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT IS</p>

<p>7859
05:10:12,326 –&gt; 05:10:14,829
DISGUSTING AND CONTRARY TO THE</p>

<p>7860
05:10:13,461 –&gt; 05:10:17,164
INTEREST OF CIVILIZATION.</p>

<p>7861
05:10:14,896 –&gt; 05:10:19,333
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.</p>

<p>7862
05:10:17,231 –&gt; 05:10:20,234
I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS</p>

<p>7863
05:10:19,400 –&gt; 05:10:21,602
INTERESTING THE COMMENT ON THE</p>

HOW HE FELT ABOUT THAT IN THE</p>

<p>7871

<p>7873

WILL FUEL COMPANY.</p>

<p>7874
05:10:43,090 –&gt; 05:10:47,828
HE REALLY SEEMED TO DOUBLE DOWN,</p>

<p>7875
05:10:45,159 –&gt; 05:10:48,129
SAYING CHEVRON IS NOT AN EVIL</p>

<p>7876

COMPANY.</p>

<p>7877
05:10:48,196 –&gt; 05:10:51,832
HE SAYS I HAVE NO COMPUNCTION</p>

<p>7878
05:10:50,331 –&gt; 05:10:54,235
ABOUT OWNING IT.</p>

<p>7879
05:10:51,899 –&gt; 05:10:59,039
IN FACT WE WENT FURTHER AND</p>

<p>7880
05:10:54,302 –&gt; 05:11:00,341
SAID, IF WE OWNED THE ENTIRE</p>

<p>7881
05:10:59,106 –&gt; 05:11:00,675
BUSINESS I WOULDN’T FEEL</p>

<p>7882
05:11:00,408 –&gt; 05:11:04,178
UNCOMFORTABLE.</p>

<p>7883
05:11:00,741 –&gt; 05:11:05,579
THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF DIVIDE</p>

WHERE INVESTMENT SENTIMENT IS.</p>

<p>7885

WE’VE GOT THE S.E.C. WEIGHING IN</p>

<p>7887

SO NOT SO SURE IN THE END IF</p>

<p>7888
05:11:09,817 –&gt; 05:11:13,587
BERKSHIRE IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR</p>

<p>7948
05:16:02,510 –&gt; 05:16:07,147
SO THE FIRST THING I LOOK FOR AT</p>

<p>7949

ANY ANNUAL MEETING WHEN I SEE</p>

IS, ARE THEY LOSING IT?</p>

<p>7952
05:16:11,285 –&gt; 05:16:17,290

BACKED UP BY A 97-YEAR-OLD MAN</p>

<p>7955
05:16:18,859 –&gt; 05:16:23,030
WITHOUT EVEN A BATHROOM BREAK</p>

<p>7956
05:16:21,295 –&gt; 05:16:26,266
BEING ASKED DOZENS OF QUESTIONS</p>

<p>7957
05:16:23,097 –&gt; 05:16:26,800
THEY HAD NO ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE</p>

<p>7961
05:16:30,838 –&gt; 05:16:33,073
TODAY.</p>

<p>7962
05:16:31,105 –&gt; 05:16:36,110
IT’S REMARKABLE.</p>

<p>7963
05:16:33,140 –&gt; 05:16:42,016
I JUST GOOGLED AVERAGE LIFE</p>

THEY’RE GIVING THE SAME ANSWERS</p>

<p>7966
05:16:43,417 –&gt; 05:16:47,254
BUT MIXING IT UP, AND THERE’S</p>

<p>7967
05:16:45,819 –&gt; 05:16:47,788
ALWAYS NEW STUFF THROWN IN</p>

<p>7980

THAT WAS A $10 BILLION MISTAKE.</p>

<p>7981
05:17:15,415 –&gt; 05:17:20,888
BUT HERE’S THE THING – I WAS</p>

EMAILING WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS</p>

<p>7983

<p>7987
05:17:30,531 –&gt; 05:17:33,634
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED OFFENSE.</p>

<p>7988
05:17:31,465 –&gt; 05:17:35,603
I SAID, TRUE, BUT THE BUFFET OF</p>

<p>7989
05:17:33,700 –&gt; 05:17:36,537
THE 20 YEARS AGO HAD A RULE, NO</p>

TECH STOCKS.</p>

<p>7991
05:17:36,604 –&gt; 05:17:41,108
SO I’M PERFECTLY FINE IF BUFFET</p>

<p>7992
05:17:39,106 –&gt; 05:17:42,843
MAKES A COMBINED $15 BILLION</p>

MISTAKE ON AIRLINES AND ON THE</p>

05:21:12,753 –&gt; 05:21:16,423
PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT.</p>

<p>8098
05:21:14,188 –&gt; 05:21:18,525
INSTEAD OF BEMOANING THE FACT HE</p>

<p>8099
05:21:16,490 –&gt; 05:21:23,030
SOLD 5% OF HIS APPLE POSITION,</p>

<p>8100
05:21:18,592 –&gt; 05:21:28,135
HE HELD ON TO 95%.</p>

<p>8101
05:21:23,097 –&gt; 05:21:28,469
AND CONSEQUENTLY – OVER</p>

<p>8102
05:21:28,202 –&gt; 05:21:32,138
$100 BILLION.</p>

<p>8103
05:21:28,535 –&gt; 05:21:33,540
AND I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCELE I</p>

<p>8104
05:21:32,205 –&gt; 05:21:37,611
BOUGHT APPLE WAY BACK WHEN.</p>

<p>8105
05:21:33,607 –&gt; 05:21:39,512
IT WENT UP 20%, AND I SOLD IT.</p>

<p>8106
05:21:37,678 –&gt; 05:21:40,247
APPLE IS NOT A TYPICAL</p>

<p>8107
05:21:39,579 –&gt; 05:21:41,615
INVESTMENT FOR BUFFET.</p>

<p>8108
05:21:40,314 –&gt; 05:21:43,750
IT’S A TECH STOCK.</p>

<p>8109
05:21:41,682 –&gt; 05:21:45,251
AFTER THE FIRST BUBBLE, YOU</p>

<p>8110
05:21:43,817 –&gt; 05:21:51,725
THINK HE WOULD HAVE – AND THE</p>

<p>8111
05:21:45,318 –&gt; 05:21:52,059
FACT THAT HE JUST – IS WHAT’S</p>

<p>8112
05:21:51,792 –&gt; 05:21:54,127
EXTRAORDINARY.</p>

<p>8113
05:21:52,126 –&gt; 05:21:55,762
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THAT,</p>

<p>8114
05:21:54,194 –&gt; 05:22:02,369
NOT CRITICIZING HE SOLD A FEW</p>

<p>8115
05:21:55,829 –&gt; 05:22:04,437
SHARES.</p>

<p>8116
05:22:02,436 –&gt; 05:22:07,841</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>YEAH, YOU WANT TO JUMP IN</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>8117
05:22:04,504 –&gt; 05:22:09,609
HERE GUYS AND TALK A LITTLE BIT</p>

<p>8118
05:22:07,908 –&gt; 05:22:10,877
ABOUT THE THEMES WHITNEY’S BEEN</p>

<p>8119
05:22:09,676 –&gt; 05:22:12,612
HITTING ON?</p>

<p>8120
05:22:10,944 –&gt; 05:22:13,680
GOING BACK TO THE FIRST SOUND WE</p>

<p>8121
05:22:12,679 –&gt; 05:22:14,714
PLAYED WHERE BUFFET IS TALKING</p>

<p>8122
05:22:13,747 –&gt; 05:22:15,482
ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF ECONOMY</p>

<p>8123
05:22:14,781 –&gt; 05:22:16,950
RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>8124
05:22:15,548 –&gt; 05:22:19,052
AND THAT WAS FRAMED OUT OF A</p>

<p>8125
05:22:17,017 –&gt; 05:22:19,820
QUESTION ON, DID BERKSHIRE MISS</p>

<p>8126
05:22:19,119 –&gt; 05:22:22,355
AN OPPORTUNITY?</p>

<p>8127
05:22:19,887 –&gt; 05:22:26,727
I THINK THE SHAREHOLDERS’</p>

<p>8128
05:22:22,422 –&gt; 05:22:29,929
QUESTION WAS, I’M INVESTING WITH</p>

<p>8129
05:22:26,794 –&gt; 05:22:31,164
BERKSHIRE, WHICH HAS</p>

<p>8130
05:22:29,996 –&gt; 05:22:34,000
$100 BILLION ON THE SHEET.</p>

<p>8131
05:22:31,231 –&gt; 05:22:35,802
YOU DIDN’T DEPLOY THAT.</p>

<p>8132
05:22:34,067 –&gt; 05:22:38,872
WHITNEY, THIS IS YOUR 23rd.</p>

<p>8133
05:22:35,869 –&gt; 05:22:40,340
THIS IS MY 6th MEETING BUT IT</p>

<p>8134
05:22:38,939 –&gt; 05:22:45,144
MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE</p>

<p>8135
05:22:40,407 –&gt; 05:22:45,812
QUESTIONS I TYPICALLY GET EVERY</p>

<p>8136
05:22:45,211 –&gt; 05:22:48,181
YEAR, WHICH ARE VERSIONS OF, WHY</p>

<p>8137
05:22:45,878 –&gt; 05:22:48,348
DIDN’T YOU DO THING “X,” THING</p>

<p>8138
05:22:48,248 –&gt; 05:22:50,450
“Y”?</p>

<p>8139
05:22:48,414 –&gt; 05:22:50,784
I BROUGHT IT UP EARLIER IN THE</p>

<p>8140
05:22:50,517 –&gt; 05:22:52,385
PROGRAM.</p>

<p>8141
05:22:50,851 –&gt; 05:22:54,921
WE DIDN’T HAVE WARREN BUFFET</p>

<p>8142
05:22:52,452 –&gt; 05:22:57,123
SITTING THERE AWAY HISTORY</p>

<p>8143
05:22:54,988 –&gt; 05:22:57,557
LESSON ABOUT THE ECONOMY SINCE</p>

<p>8144
05:22:57,190 –&gt; 05:22:59,293
WORLD WAR II.</p>

<p>8145
05:22:57,624 –&gt; 05:23:00,627
HE WASN’T DEFENDING THE STATE OF</p>

<p>8146
05:22:59,359 –&gt; 05:23:03,196
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN A WAY I</p>

<p>8147
05:23:00,693 –&gt; 05:23:05,632
THINK HE’S GOTTEN USED TO OR</p>

<p>8148
05:23:03,263 –&gt; 05:23:08,835
ALMOST FELT THE NEED TO, AND I</p>

<p>8149
05:23:05,699 –&gt; 05:23:09,502
THOUGHT THAT WAS MAYBE A</p>

<p>8150
05:23:08,902 –&gt; 05:23:10,937
REFRESHING IS THE WORD THAT CAME</p>

<p>8151
05:23:09,569 –&gt; 05:23:13,273
TO MY MIND, BECAUSE IT’S THE</p>

<p>8152
05:23:11,004 –&gt; 05:23:14,674
STUFF THAT COMES UP EVERY ANNUAL</p>

<p>8153
05:23:13,340 –&gt; 05:23:18,011
MEETING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF</p>

<p>8154
05:23:14,741 –&gt; 05:23:19,312
SECOND GUESSING, BUFFET DOING</p>

<p>8155
05:23:18,078 –&gt; 05:23:21,114
HIS MACRO ANALYSIS.</p>

<p>8156
05:23:19,379 –&gt; 05:23:22,882
WASN’T THE SAME THING AS LAST</p>

<p>8157
05:23:21,181 –&gt; 05:23:25,552
YEAR WHEN EVERYTHING, FOR</p>

<p>8158
05:23:22,949 –&gt; 05:23:27,354
OBVIOUS REASONS, BUT EVERYTHING</p>

<p>8159
05:23:25,618 –&gt; 05:23:28,655
WAS FRAMED THROUGH THE STATE OF</p>

<p>8160
05:23:27,420 –&gt; 05:23:29,790
THE PANDEMIC, WHAT’S GOING TO</p>

<p>8161
05:23:28,722 –&gt; 05:23:31,191
HAPPEN NEXT?</p>

<p>8162
05:23:29,857 –&gt; 05:23:32,826
WARREN, PLEASE TELL US?</p>

<p>8163
05:23:31,258 –&gt; 05:23:34,494
I THINK AS HE SAID – WHAT WAS</p>

<p>8164
05:23:32,893 –&gt; 05:23:34,761
THAT JOKE FROM THE NEBRASKA</p>

<p>8165
05:23:34,561 –&gt; 05:23:36,730
GOVERNOR?</p>

<p>8166
05:23:34,828 –&gt; 05:23:37,730
I’M ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ONE.</p>

<p>8167
05:23:36,796 –&gt; 05:23:38,998
HE DIDN’T REALLY HAVE A COMMENT</p>

<p>8168
05:23:37,797 –&gt; 05:23:40,867
ON THAT LAST YEAR, AND IT WAS</p>

<p>8169
05:23:39,065 –&gt; 05:23:42,102
SORT OF THE ONLY THING THAT</p>

<p>8170
05:23:40,934 –&gt; 05:23:47,507
EVERYONE WANTED TO HEAR.</p>

<p>8171
05:23:42,169 –&gt; 05:23:48,875</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>YEAH, I WOULD JUST SAY, THIS</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>8172
05:23:47,574 –&gt; 05:23:51,177
IS THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS</p>

<p>8173
05:23:48,942 –&gt; 05:23:52,212
THE THIRD BIG BUST IN THE 23</p>

<p>8174
05:23:51,244 –&gt; 05:23:55,549
YEARS I HAVE BEEN COMING.</p>

<p>8175
05:23:52,279 –&gt; 05:23:58,351
THERE WAS THE AFTERMATH OF THE</p>

<p>8176
05:23:55,616 –&gt; 05:23:58,752
INTERNET BUBBLE, THE GLOBAL</p>

<p>8177
05:23:58,418 –&gt; 05:24:00,087
FINANCIAL CRISIS.</p>

<p>8178
05:23:58,818 –&gt; 05:24:02,355
IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW SIMILAR</p>

<p>8179
05:24:00,153 –&gt; 05:24:03,857
THE TONE WAS A YEAR AGO,</p>

<p>8180
05:24:02,422 –&gt; 05:24:05,758
REASSURING PEOPLE, NEVER BET</p>

<p>8181
05:24:03,924 –&gt; 05:24:09,796
AGAINST AMERICA.</p>

<p>8182
05:24:05,825 –&gt; 05:24:10,230
WE’RE GOING TO COME BACK.</p>

<p>8183
05:24:09,863 –&gt; 05:24:12,465
ST</p>

<p>8184
05:24:10,296 –&gt; 05:24:14,200
 SIMILAR TO 2009 WHEN THE</p>

<p>8185
05:24:12,532 –&gt; 05:24:15,202
MEETING WAS A MONTH AFTER THE</p>

<p>8186
05:24:14,267 –&gt; 05:24:17,303
BOTTOM LIKE LAST YEAR.</p>

<p>8187
05:24:15,269 –&gt; 05:24:18,838
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST MISTAKE</p>

<p>8188
05:24:17,370 –&gt; 05:24:20,406
INFORMSERS MAKE IS WE’RE TOO</p>

<p>8189
05:24:18,905 –&gt; 05:24:22,041
BEARISH AND ALWAYS SEEING THE</p>

<p>8190
05:24:20,473 –&gt; 05:24:23,776
NEXT STORM AND ALWAYS GETTING</p>

<p>8191
05:24:22,108 –&gt; 05:24:25,412
TOO DEFENSIVE AND SELLING OUR</p>

<p>8192
05:24:23,843 –&gt; 05:24:34,387
WINNERS TOO EARLY AND BUFFET TO</p>

<p>8193
05:24:25,479 –&gt; 05:24:35,622
HIS CREDIT HAS MANEINTAINED FOR0</p>

<p>8194
05:24:34,454 –&gt; 05:24:37,824
PLUS YEAR OPTIMISM ABOUT AMERICA</p>

<p>8195
05:24:35,689 –&gt; 05:24:39,126
AND PUT MONEY TO WORK WHEN OTHER</p>

<p>8196
05:24:37,891 –&gt; 05:24:41,194
INVESTORS ARE PANICKING.</p>

<p>8197
05:24:39,192 –&gt; 05:24:43,263
I WISH HE HAD DONE A LITTLE BIT</p>

<p>8198
05:24:41,261 –&gt; 05:24:44,998
MORE OF THAT A YEAR AGO, BUT</p>

<p>8199
05:24:43,330 –&gt; 05:24:46,533
GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT’S</p>

<p>8200
05:24:45,065 –&gt; 05:24:50,970
QUIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES.</p>

<p>8201
05:24:46,600 –&gt; 05:24:52,906
HE HAS FUNDAMENT ALLY BEEN RIGH</p>

<p>8202

HIS ENTIRE REAR AND BEEN</p>

<p>8203
05:24:52,973 –&gt; 05:24:56,309
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA.</p>

<p>8204
05:24:55,575 –&gt; 05:24:56,576
IT’S EASY NOW TO HAVE THAT</p>

<p>8205
05:24:56,376 –&gt; 05:24:57,176
VIEWPOINT.</p>

<p>8206
05:24:56,643 –&gt; 05:24:59,479

INFLATION.</p>

<p>8274

THE GREAT TAKEAWAY IS THIS IS A</p>

GREAT TIME TO BE AN INVESTOR IN</p>

<p>8279

THERE ARE ONLY SIX AMERICAN</p>

<p>8323

THOSE BIG TECH NAMES.</p>

<p>8330

MILES SAID, WARREN BUFFET HAS</p>

<p>8332

LATEST CPAC.</p>

<p>8340

<p>8341
05:32:11,978 –&gt; 05:32:16,682
WILL ADD, BECAUSE THE LATEST</p>

ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS.</p>

<p>8365

THEY WERE ALSO ASKED ABOUT</p>

<p>8366
05:32:56,790 –&gt; 05:33:01,861
VALUATIONS, WHETHER THEY THOUGHT</p>

<p>8367
05:32:59,925 –&gt; 05:33:03,062
THEY WERE TOO SKY HIGH.</p>

<p>8368

THEY WERE IN HE TALKED ABOUT</p>

05:33:04,330 –&gt; 05:33:08,701
THAT RELATIVE TO INTEREST RATES,</p>

<p>8371

AKIKO, SAYING YOU’VE GOT</p>

INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, IT</p>

<p>8373
05:33:10,937 –&gt; 05:33:14,307
MAKES STOCKS LOOK MUCH LESS</p>

<p>8374

EXPENSIVE.</p>

<p>8375
05:33:14,374 –&gt; 05:33:17,910
YOU DIVERSE INTO NEGATIVE</p>

<p>8376
05:33:15,508 –&gt; 05:33:18,945
INTEREST RATES, SOME INTERESTING</p>

<p>8377

<p>8378
05:33:19,012 –&gt; 05:33:22,515
ANOTHER THING THAT CAUGHT MY EAR</p>

<p>8379
05:33:21,147 –&gt; 05:33:24,550
WAS HIS DISCUSSION OF AUTO</p>

<p>8380

STOCKS AND THE HUNDREDS OF AUTO</p>

<p>8381

STOCKS THAT EXISTED 100 YEARS OR</p>

SO IN THIS COUNTRY AND HOW THEY</p>

<p>8383
05:33:31,958 –&gt; 05:33:33,493
ALL TURNED OUT TO BE BAD</p>

<p>8384
05:33:33,259 –&gt; 05:33:34,427
INVESTMENTS.</p>

<p>8385
05:33:33,560 –&gt; 05:33:35,895
THAT WAS INTERESTING.</p>

<p>8386
05:33:34,494 –&gt; 05:33:37,464
ANOTHER POINT I THOUGHT WAS</p>

<p>8387
05:33:35,962 –&gt; 05:33:41,634
INTERESTING WAS HIS TAKE LATE IN</p>

<p>8388

SAYING THE ECONOMY WAS HOT.</p>

<p>8391
05:33:46,806 –&gt; 05:33:49,875
BUFFET SAID IT WAS RED-HOT, AS A</p>

<p>8392
05:33:48,775 –&gt; 05:33:52,612
MATTER OF FACT, AND THAT THERE</p>

<p>8393
05:33:49,942 –&gt; 05:33:54,280

<p>8394

<p>8447
